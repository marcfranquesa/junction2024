Introduction of the members of the development working group 
The members of the development working group introduced themselves. 
5 
Current review of Datahub 
5.1 
Customer service – Jenni Mäkinen 
Jenni Mäkinen reviewed, in accordance with a separate presentation (Appendix 3), how customer service is going, based on which shortcomings emerged that Fingrid promised to start improving: 
• 
Pia Aaltonen, Suvi Manninen and Päivi Karppanen brought up open tickets from February-March and asked for feedback from Fingrid on whether they have progressed. 
• 
Pia pointed out that there is room for improvement in the ticket system user interface (requesting a ticket is challenging, the name of a market participant came as a commentator). 
• 
Suvi Manninen commented that the ticketing instructions are outdated (e.g. is there still a need for service request in the title?). 
5.2 
Development team – Marko Juslin 
Marko introduced the development unit personnel in accordance with a separate presentation. (Appendix 4) 
The development unit is also supported by many other parties, such as CGI's support and maintenance team, 
Fingid DoIT, external consultants, CGI's product team and the Development Working Group, 
on the basis of which a correction proposal was raised for Fingrid: 
• 
Pia Aaltonen commented that the slides are missing, that the datahub is invisible to the 
end customer / Marko said that the comment will be taken into account. 
Marko also emphasized that the purpose of the development working group is to evaluate the added value of the development proposals to the sector, when the cost level of the development proposal is known. 
6 
Review of the operating model – Marko Juslin 
Marko reviewed the development working group's operating model in accordance with a separate presentation. (Appendix 2 and 
Appendix 7). 
During the review, the following observations were raised: 
• 
Pia commented that the processes are not described clearly enough in the 
market documentation. The text still needs to be clarified and clear 
terms used. 
• 
Pia said that there are still challenges in updating contract information for large customers. Notifying several new contracts to the same 
customer at the same time results in an error. 
• 
Suvi said that too many errors are allowed when updating customer information: 
e.g. the system allows a hyphen in the last name, the official 
names of companies are not used, etc. => doubts were raised whether Datahub contacted the sources of incorrect information.

• 
Greetta asked for clarification on the development topic instructions: how to 
specify in the ticketthat it is a development proposal. Elina stated that she can at the moment 
act so that the word "Development proposal" is written at the beginning of the title. 
• 
Pia raised a point regarding the handling of errors - should there be a chat or a common one 
a forum where you can discuss errors detected even at a small threshold (e.g. 
not everyone can access the Teams channel) – could you ask the parties? 
Greetta asked through which different channels development proposals can be raised. Marko said that 
all development proposals from outside Fingri must be raised as tickets. Also 
the new development proposals that may come in the meeting of the development team will come 
withdraw as tickets and that's how they enter the processing process. 
The development group is not supposed to go through troubleshooting tickets, but to make development proposals. 
Of course, there can be a gray situation, when an existing problem is fixed by changing 
method of operation and in these cases the matter should be brought to the attention of the development team 
for processing. In any case, in all meetings of the development team, 
to reserve some time also for the current datahub situation and key issues 
for informing about problems and faults. The main focus in the meetings of the development work group is 
however, in the processing of development proposals. 
There was a discussion about the minutes of the retail market development group, which Greetta 
Arha had delivered to the development team. Greetta initiated the activities of that group and 
to the protocol delivery development group (Appendix 5). Markon told the different problems of the protocol
about the situation of tickets raised for topics, which is being corrected in version 1.9.0 (update 
planned for production in September 2022) and which are still in progress. There are two fixes 
coming to a non-contractual situation to problems related to the place of use. Another one of these 
corrections were also related to challenges with balance sheet agreements. Missing measurement data 
regarding the reminder, a correction is coming in version 1.9.0. 
The clarification of the problem related to larger searches related to places of use is in progress (ticket 
can be found). 
There was a discussion about the challenges related to correcting the contract dates. Pia told 
that the situation from the seller's point of view is impossible, decades old 
contracts should be cancelled, invoices refunded, invoiced again, etc. so that it is possible 
report the contract again to datahub on the correct start date. Pia also suggested that 
a new status "Under renovation" would be brought to the place of use so that the start dates are known 
changes could be avoided. There is no ticket for this yet. 
There are three development proposals related to the challenges caused by updating customer data 
from the industry on the development team's list to be processed. In addition, the customer data master -
regarding information management, Fingrid is already considering various ways to make it easier 
problem. These are intended to be brought to the next meetings of the development group for processing. 
Marko also pointed out that a ticket has not necessarily been created for all problems, so 
it is necessary to make sure that the ticket can be found. 
The discussion brought up the following considerations, questions and needs for corrections for Fingrid 
to consider:

• 
Greetta pointed out that it is discussed in two different development work groups (FG and ET). 
datahub/industry guidelines/development, even though they are separate from each other 
instances... i.e. how to make them serve each other better. Why ET isn't 
involved in the development team? / Fingrid finds out. 
• 
Pia stated that practical use cases in the instructions would help 
to understand which practice works, e.g. in cancellation situations. 
•

implement (e.g. changes in the dates of contracts)?
