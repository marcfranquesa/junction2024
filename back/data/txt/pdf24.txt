According to one of the cases in the UC.DDQ.REQ.ACP.ID
test, we need to implement accounting point search using
related accounting point identification (RAPI). As we
understand the test, we should provide the DDQ an option that
if an AP is found using regular address based search and if
the AP has a related AP that did not appear in the original
search, then the DDQ can find the related AP using RAPI.
However, at the moment the search requires that both post
of ice (city) and street name are present in the search
key words. I think the search would be much more useful, if it
would allow searching by RAPI only. This way the DDQ can
alway s retrieve an AP by knowing the address of the related
AP. For instance, in some rare cases, the AP might be located
on the edge of a county and the AP and related AP can hav e
quite different addresses. If we always require some address
inf ormation in the search, then in most cases it is easier f or
the DDQ to search by address only, since it must be more or
DH-131 transaction changed: The seller or a third party can also apply
information about the place of use by entering the place of use ID in the search, if there is one

Information to be reported: Address of the place of use, part of the address or
workplace ID. Freely
as search factors you can also use meter number, type of place of use,
the ID of the parallel access point or the address of the access point.

It has been recognized that all grid products are not possible to
represent in the Datahub data model, especially complex ones
- these could be e.g. products with different kinds of Peak
power calculation rules. This is of course fine. However, the grid
product code is mandatory in the grid agreement confirmation
ev ent, DH-312. So, there will be products which are not
represented in the Datahub, but they are referred to in the
ev ent. There are the requirements and validations on the
ev ent "The product reported for the agreement must be f ound
in Datahub, be in ef f ect when the agreement starts and Belong
to the reporting market party.". How is this Supposed to be
handled? Is it expected that some sort of dummy products,
without any product components, should be established? Note
that this doesn't seem to be possible currently, according to
the cardinality in the Data Standard.

we don't know from the message that is the data consumption

At the present metering data messages (E66) include only the metering point

the accounting point type pe (AG01-consumption, AG02-production).
Is it possible to add also the accounting point type pe to the E66 messages as an
optional additional info?
Measurement information messages (E66) contain information about the type of measurement point (F01-

Information about the type of place of use is added to the message as optional additional information.

2 Datahub's processes are synchronous, but unfortunately
often ATJ syncs structural data in the direction of MDM
at set times, e.g. once an hour / day. Especially
in retroactive cases, Datahub may receive it
measurement data before ATJ has established a place of use
For MDM, because the establishment is made only when the contract
Activates. Especially in this case it would be useful
if the E66 message was accompanied by the address of the place of use
(Accounting point value AG01=Consumption
AG02=Production). It would also help to validate if
ATJ provided the right type of place of use.

Change of the VAT percentage planned by the government and product transactions (DH-714 and DH-718) and contract update transactions (DH-321)
We have received a question from our customers about how the possible VAT percentage reduction planned by the government can be applied to products "The government is planning to
in order to reduce electricity bills in the coming winter, and one option to be considered is the reduction of the additional tax on electricity.".

In the product information there is VAT percentage. Updating the VAT
percentage should be possible without notifying a new product.

In the acknowledgement of the cancellation of the sales contract, the seller shall provide information on whether the sales contract remained valid and for what until the day.
Now I'll have to go to the customer service to see if I can
certainly clarify the situation.
When a seller cancels a sales contract retroactively, the sales contract will remain valid for a certain period of time in certain situations. At present, the seller does not issue a notification about the situation after cancellation, but the seller can only find out the situation by checking Datahub. When a supplier cancels a sales agreement retrospectiv ely , there are situations
in which the sales agreement remains v alid f or a certain period of time.
Currently , the supplier is not notified of the situation after the cancellation, and
the supplier needs to check it in datahub.

For network contract confirmation, check that the sales and
network contract are with the same customer. Currently
there is no customer in the network contract confirmation. This does
not prevent the situation that the network would make a network contract for a different customer. The network may have a different customer in its own system than in the hub. So it is the full responsibility of the grid to ensure that the contract is for the customer specified in the DH-
311-2 message.
A new validation is needed to check that grid and sales agreements are for the
same customer when confirming the grid contract. At the moment, there is no customer in the grid agreement confirmation request. This means that a DSO
could make the grid agreement for another customer. DSO can hav e a
customer in their own sy Stem that is dif f erent f rom the one in datahub.
Currently, this means that it is the DSO's responsibility to make sure that the

Hi latty
(pin 2)
Did we have guidelines when the DSO should update the
estimated y early consumption when a new sales agreement is
created?
If we don't have those y et, would it be possible to write those
so that the DSO needs to update the EYC after the new sales
agreement has become valid? Reasoning is that then the new
supplier would get the updated information.
If the SAO updates the EYC when a new sales agreement is
forwarded, the new supplier does not get the new EYC in
DH-122-2 or DH-122-4.
Building a scheduled DH-132 for the new supplier seems
counter intuitive since the data could as be forwarded to the
new supplier. It also causes unnecessary messages if the
new supplier starts to query the updated ACP data every day
until the new sales agreement is valid.
If the distribution network operator announces an update of the annual usage estimate when
a new contract is coming to the place of use, datahub should issue a new one
annual value of use also for new sales. The update should be announced even if
the new contract is not yet in force at the time of the annual consumption estimate update,
but
the datahub already has information about the upcoming sales.
In case a distribution system operator notifies an estimated early consumption
update f or an accounting point with a future agreement (not valid at the time of the update), datahub should notify the new estimated early consumption also to the new/future supplier.

0 1 The change would be a major fundamental change in Datahub if the notification of the change of location were sent to the new vendor before the current contract. On the other hand, the change in JVH's processes would be major if the notification to Datahub was required after the start of the sales contract. In all processes, the principle applies that the right to information is only valid for the period of validity of the agreement. Here, an exception would be made to that general principle, which has also been discussed with the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. The need for change should be justified in more detail. Let's see if there is a need to think about something. detour,
e.g.- email to seller when information is updated.

For example, the mandatory fields in the billing address form are not highlighted/starred even though they are there.
These only become apparent when you are about to send the information.
Filling in customer information There is also a lack of highlighting of mandatory information, such as name and contact information. There was also a discussion that it would be great if the form had the functionality to highlight the mandatory fields that are generated when the user selects a certain customer type. .
The mandatory fields are not highlighted or marked with stars e.g. in the
inv oicing address form even if there is some mandatory field to be filled in. User
gets notification aboutt missing f ields when try ing to submit the f orm. In the

The data subject's right to limit their data according to the GDPR
processing ä.
According to the Data Protection Regulation (art. 18), the data subject has
in certain situations, the right to the data controller
restrict processing ä. Processing in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation approx
restriction means that data can still be stored,
but for other processing y n (such as e.g. data
to transfer), should be specified in the Data protection regulation
established basis (e.g. consent of the registered person, processing
to protect the rights of another party).  I don't join Datahub
as the only processing according to the Data Protection Regulation approx
as a reason for limitation, it may come into question,
that the data subject disputes the accuracy of the personal data.
According to the Data Protection Ordinance, the processing is then limited a
for a time until the controller has been able to confirm
the accuracy of the information.
The registrant's right to restrict data processing (concerns customer data) must be flexible. In the centralized information exchange model, there are parties to whom information about the restriction must be delivered
In addition to Datahub, at least 1 seller and network, if there are other contracts in force, information about the restriction must be provided to them as well.
According to the GDPR, the restriction is intended as a temporary measure during which the controller verifies the accuracy of the data. In the case of Datahub
there are several data controllers, but in the data model, the seller is always responsible for customer data. Therefore, when the customer is in contact, the seller's customer information remains in place
for negligence, the seller's manager should check the information and update the incorrect information to Datahub as well.
According to the GDPR registered has rights to limit the handling of her/his
data.
According to the data priv acy art 18 registered has in certain situations right
that Registry owner limits handling of data. That means that those data can be
still stored in the datahub, but f or other handling (like e.g. abandonment of data)
shall require a specific justification as legislated in data priv acy art (like
registered approval, handling data to protect other person's rights). In datahub
case the only handling limitation justification, according to the data priv acy art,
could be that registered deny es the correctness of personal data. According to
the data privacy art, the handling of data shall be stopped until the Registry
owner has been able to make sure that the personal data is correct.
If restriction is to be implemented, it is the data hub's message traffic
reasoning is difficult. Restriction should prevent all updates,
daily Spy sales and new sales contracts for the customer whose information
processing is limited. Because it is impossible to define which party would be
eventually entitled to deliver despite the restriction, the correct information would fall
checking data from the end customer to the Datahub operator. This nostwould
Datahub's operator's workload significantly and thus increased
salary costs would increase Datahub's operating costs
significantly. In addition, this would mean that Datahub takes on a bigger responsibility
about checking and correcting the correctness of the end customers' data every
is not appropriate. When it is also taken into account that the seller should

Recommendation 1

Customer has a fixed term contract until 13 September 2022. However, move-out was
created for 30.9.2021. After the move-out being accepted by Datahub, customer
informs a new invoicing address. We update it to our system and that generates
DH-321-1. However, DH-321-1 is rejected by Datahub due to "Attribute 'Fixed
Term End Date' must be the same as or earlier than '2021-09-30T21:00:00Z'.". As
we are not trying to make any changes to the fixed term end date (same date is
in the DH-321-1 as is already in the customer contract in Datahub), why is the
message rejected? Is there a reason why Datahub is concerned about the fixed
term end date when contract is anyway ending (and ending was successful even
although fixed term and date is after the end date)? Could we expect changes
coming to the rules here in the near future?
In cases of move-out getting cancelled, it would be better that the fixed term ends
date is the "original" one.
The customer has had a fixed-term contract valid until September 13, 2022, but the customer's move out has been notified to Datahub for September 30, 2021 (= termination of the contract). After announcing the move out, the customer has announced
of his new billing address, which has been attempted to be updated for the contract in Datahub with DH-321-1, but Datahub rejects the notification with the reason "Attribute 'Fixed Term End Date' must be same as or earlier than '2021-09-30T21:00:00Z'", or
Datahub does not accept that the update message contains an end date later than the end date of the contract.
In this case, with DH-321-1, no attempt was made to update/change the expiration date of the contract from the date already in Datahub, but the information (end date) is always included in the contract update message,
when it is a fixed-term contract.
In this case, you would also not want to change the end date of the fixed period, so that the original date is preserved in case of a possible cancellation of the move out.
Customer had a fixed term contract valid until 13.9.2022, but a move-out was reported to Datahub for
30.9.2021 (= contract end). After the move-out was reported, the customer notified the supplier of a
new invoicing address which the supplier tried to update to Datahub using DH-321. Datahub rejected
the DH-321 due to validation rule "Attribute 'Fixed Term End Date' must be the same as or earlier than
'2021-09-30T21:00:00Z' (i.e. Datahub does not accept an agreement update where the fixed end date
is later than the agreement end date).
In this case, DH-321 did not contain an update to the fixed term dates (dates were the same as already
in Datahub) but the dates are always included in the update request (if the agreement is fixed term).
In this case, the supplier would not want to change the fixed term end date in order to keep the original
end date in case the move-out (agreement end) gets cancelled.
Validation related to deadlines should be done in DH-321
only if changes are made to the deadlines/dates. If DH-

Fixed term date validation rules should only be used if the fixed term
information/dates are actually updated, i.e. no v alidation done on the fixed term
dates in DH-321 if the fixed term dates in the request are the same as already in
the database. A condition for this has already been implemented for or

The message sent directly by the data hub cannot be received

identifier), in which case nothing can be concluded from this. If

there cannot be any conclusion. If it would be used instead of the DH-421-1

on terminating or canceling the sales contract only, if applicable
the network contract has been confirmed. Let's change the processes in such a way that the intermediary s
also happens to an unverified network contract.
Note DH-331 starts the process chain with a confirmed network contract
for termination, if the sales contract ends with moving out.
In the case of an unconfirmed network contract, we will only mediate
information about the end of the sales contract (the process chain is not started).
Currently, the DH-331 and DH-341 processes send a notification to the DSO
only if the corresponding grid agreement is confirmed. The processes will be
changed so that a notification is sent also if the grid agreement is unconf irmed.
Note: DH-331 starts a composite process for or ending the corresponding grid
agreement if the sales agreement ends due to a mov e-out. In case of an

there would be no need to state the days, because the days are set for the message
does not necessarily match the existing agreement and with them
has no effect on anything. An example case where
fixed-term contract started already in 2014 and fixed-term
you can put the start date of the contract in the DH-321-1 message
a maximum of 3.5 years retroactive to the date.
When supplier updates contract information e.g. invoice address, shall the DH-
321-1 message hav e also fixed term start and end dates. The supplier had
dev elopment proposal that it would not be necessary to inform those dates
because the dates in the message do not necessarily match with existing ones
contract and those have no impact on anything. E.g. case where fixed term
contract has already started f rom y ear 2014 and fixed term contract start date
in the DH-321-1 message can have a maximum of 3.5 years retrospective date.

As a network company, we feel the cancellation code AR04 very strongly
inconvenient. The AR04 code can be used at this time even if the seller
would have concluded the contract as a supply contract. It can't be like this
really be that the customer cancels the sale, if that is the case
is a supply contract. So, in terms of this, the data hub should have it
reasoning that the delivery contract cannot be canceled due to AR04, or
if yes, then the network contract should be canceled here as well
y htey dese. There isn'tit is possible for the customer to receive from someone else
the seller cancels the delivery contract if the seller responsible for delivery leaves
has already canceled the contract.
Could the reason for this cancellation and its functionality be raised
to be brought up again, if necessary, in some new development group,
we would see that this would require further specification/implementation
in the direction of the data hub.
As a DSO we see the cancellation code AR04 very complex. AR04 code can
be used ev en supplier has made contract as deliv ery contract. That can't
happen in real that end customer cancels only selling if there is delivery
contract. Datahub should conclude that the delivery contract cannot be cancelled
with AR04 code or if it can be cancelled, then grid contract shall be canceled as
well. It is not possible that the end customer can get delivery from another supplier
contract if delivery responsible supplier has already canceled the contract.
Could this cancellation reason and its rules be re-evaluated in development
workgroup. This requires new definitions to the datahub rules.
I will give up using AR04 completely: network companies have to every time
cancel your own contract when the seller cancels the contract. The thought has been
in the background that the network contract would have remained there if AR04 was in use. It has been
situations where the network contract has not been concluded completely.
It will be abjured about use of the cancellation code AR04 entirely : Grid
companies need every time to cancel their own agreement when the supplier cancels
agreement. The idea on background has been that in case using AR04, the grid
agreement would remain. There have been situations where the grid agreement has not
been made at all.

Cancellations to be reported to AR04 datahub. It was pointed out that
these AR04 cancellations cause a lot of extra work and

is canceled due to AR04, the network contract does not end in the data hub.
When the new seller ships on a later day
The customer already has a sales contract and network contract

however, would like to change the start date of the online contract
in accordance with the sales contract, V Erko should cancel for a different date
signed network contract, before the new one comes into force.
At the same time, however, also the sales contract of the new seller
is cancelled. Solving the situation requires the seller and V Erko

The contract code should be added to message DH-341-3:
How to restore the alignment of the DH-341-3 message
agreementI am not supposed to do this. We have encountered a situation where the site has a current sales contract and a future sales contract. Another vendor announces a move-in for the current contract, which means that the future sales contract is cancelled (message DH-311-5). The move-in by the other vendor was cancelled and Datahub sent two DH-341-3 messages (identical except for the message's unique identifier). How should these messages be allocated to returned contracts when they only contain the site identifier and the cancelled move-in date? If the cancellation of the sales contract reinstates the previous or future sales contract, the information about the cancellation is sent to the vendor of the returned contract. However, the message does not contain information (identity) about the contract based on which the message was sent. For example, if two contracts are returned to the same seller, the seller receives the same message twice (the only difference is the message ID).
Agreement identification should be added to the DH-341-3 notification.
We had a case where a metering point had a valid sales agreement and also a sales agreement starting in the future. Another supplier reported a mov e-in ending the valid agreement and canceling the future agreement.
Mov e-in made by the other supplier was canceled and datahub sent two DH-341-3 notifications (f ully identical except f or the message id). How should the notifications be connected to the restored agreements when they include only a metering point id and the date of the canceled mov ed-in?

Change in the status of the site The definition of the connected site should be reassessed. The functionality at this time is that if the metering point under construction has a valid contract at the time of connection, datahub will automatically change the contract to the valid start date according to the switching date. This serves to process new projects. But the same functionality is also available when the metering point is changed to a state under construction due to renovation, without affecting the contract status. In this case, if the network changes the state to directly connected, the valid start date of the metering point will be changed according to the same rules, although this would not be the case in this situation. Metering point state change from "Under construction" to the "Switched" rules shall be re-evaluated. The current rules say that if metering point "Under construction" has a valid contract when it is switch on, datahub will automatically contract a valid start date according to the switching date. This server

A change in the connection status will also cause an update to the effective dates of the agreements when the object is undergoing renovation and has been changed to the under construction status. It has been instructed that in this case the site must first be changed to the disconnected status before connecting. This avoids the need to update the agreements.
Could the change include, for example, a different connection status for renovation sites? In this case, there would be no need to build complex reasoning based on the previous agreement/connection status.

The accuracy of the measurement data
We discussed in the energy industry's electricity measurement and balance settlement working group
accuracy of measurement data. Especially when switching to 15 min measurement in small ones
it would be good to recommend a storage resolution of 1Wh.
Previously, it was asked whether Datahub also accepts 1Wh accuracy
measurement data and at that time we were left with the understanding that Datahub could
delivers measurement data with an accuracy of 1Wh.
In the guide: Business processes of the electricity retail market in Datahub
on page 106 it says so
"For applications with a fuse size or equivalent
the electric power is a maximum of 3x63 A, the measurement data must be reported for 10 watt hours
give or take. In other respects
measurement data must be reported with an accuracy of at least a kilowatt hour"
This instruction can now be interpreted so that Datahub should be delivered more precisely than
Measurement data for 10Wh accuracy.
Should that instruction be updated, so that it becomes clear that you can also use 1Wh
accuracy, but 10Wh accuracy is the minimum requirement?
Or have we misunderstood and 10Wh with more detailed information is not allowed
measurement data.
ML: "So the measurement data can be delivered with an accuracy of 1 Wh. However, for places of use,
whose fuse size or equivalent electric power is a maximum of 3X63 A, measurement data
must be delivered with an accuracy of at least 10 Wh.
Your comment is good and this could be specified more clearly in the instructions. I'll put it
forward to the list of development proposals.
Time series data would be sent to datahub with 1 Wh accuracy on accounting
points with f use size or equiv alent electric power max. 3x63 A. The instructions
clarif ied f or accuracy to be used f or sending of data with dif f erent f use sizes.
In accordance with the proposal of ET's hourly measurement and balance sheet clarification group, with small
for objects (max 3x63 A) it is recommended to submit the measurement data to datahub 2.0
works with an accuracy of 1 Wh after switching on. Datahub already has at the moment
the technical readiness receives the data with an accuracy of 1 Wh.
Let's clarify Datahub's instructions regarding the accuracy of measurement data:
"Measurement data can be delivered to the data hub with an accuracy of 1 Wh. For places of use,
whose fuse size or equivalent electric power is no more than 3x63 A,
it is recommended to deliver measurement data with an accuracy of 1 Wh, the minimum requirement is 10
Wh. For places of use where the fuse size or the corresponding electric power is
greater than 3x63 A, the minimum requirement for the accuracy of measurement data is 1 kWh.".
Current text formatting: "For applications where fuse size or equivalent
the electric power is a maximum of 3x63 A, the measurement data must be reported for 10 watt hours

1) CAP should show only the organizations that are able to permit
authorizations (not else)
INCUSE0000056492 - DH9 CAP: all organizations in CMS are displayed in
CAP in authorization creation
This change would remove eg. the companies made for assignments
2) Additionally there should be noted the changes needed for assignment
groups
Note: Design document changes also need to take place due to this change
Authorization for energy reporting should only be possible for the THP role. In addition, unnecessary authorization purposes for 3rd parties are removed.
Required DH-810 changes:
1) DH-811 Customer Authorization - Vendor
- Remove authorization from design for vendor with purpose AP01 = Energy reporting (customer has contract for point of use)
- New rule to prevent creation of authorization for vendor with purpose AP01
2) DH-812 Customer Authorization - 3rd party
- Remove authorization from design for 3rd party with purposes AP02 = Request for quotation (customer has contract for point of use) and AP04 = Request for quotation (customer has no contract for point of use)
- New rule to prevent creation of authorization for 3rd party with purpose AP2 or AP04
3) DH-813 Customer Drain - DSO
- Not required, DSO cannot create authorization (-> DSO can only act as customer's authorized person with role THP)
- New rule to prevent creation of authorization for the grid operator
CAP changes:
1) Only organizations that can be authorized are shown in the CAP (currently, organizations that have a mandate can also be selected, but these should not be used for authorizations). Note also that in the future
it is not possible to create an authorization for the grid operator (only when operating in the THP role).
2) The above-mentioned changes must also be taken into account when the customer makes an authorization in the CAP (DH-820). The same rules apply to authorizations reported by the customer as those reported in DH-810.
Note. Design documents must also be updated as part of this change.
For the authorization type "Energy Reporting", according to the process document
it is only possible to give authorization to the role of a third party (THP). Currently
datahub validations also allow this for other roles. Let's change the validations
so that this will only be allowed with the role THP, i.e.
service provider.
Required changes to DH-810 process:
1) DH-811 Customer Authorization - Vendor
- New rule to prevent the creation of an authorization for a vendor due to AP01=
Energy Reporting
2) DH-812 Customer Authorization - 3rd Party
- New rule to prevent the creation of an authorization for a 3rd party due to
AP02=Request for Proposal (customer has a contract for a site) or
AP03=Contract for Service (customer has a contract for a site)
3) DH-813 Customer Authorization - Grid Operator
- New rule to prevent the creation of an authorization for a Grid Operator
CAP changes related to the changes to DH-800 processes above:
1) CAP should only show organizations to which the end customer has the right to grant
authorization (currently, for example, ös organisations that have been created for the purpose of the assignment are shown in the CAP). This change would remove, for example, companies that have been created for the purpose of the assignment.
2) The changes mentioned above also apply to the CAP/DH-820 process. The same rules for creating authorisations apply to both the DH-810 process and the end-customer authorisations in the CAP.
For authorisation type "Energy reporting" it is possible to give authorisation only for the third party (THP) role. At the moment datahub validation allows that for other roles as well. Change the validation rules so that the reporting is allowed only for the THP (service provider) role.
Needed changes into DH-810 process:
1) New Customer Authorization by Supplier (DH-811):
 - new rule to prevent creation of authorization f or the supplier with reason AP01 =
Energy reporting
2) New Customer Authorization by Third Party (DH-812):
 - new rule to prevent creation of authorization for the third party with reason
AP02 = Bid ​​request (customer has agreement at the accounting point) or AP03 =
Contract competitiv e Tendering as serv ice (customer agreement to accounting
points)
3) New Customer Authorization by DSO (DH-813):
- add new rule to prevent creation of authorization f or DSO
CAP changes related to the DH-800 changes abov e:
1) CAP shall only show the organizations that can be authorized (currently, f or
example, also organizations with delegations are shown, but these shall not be
used for authorizations).
This change would remove e.g. the companies made for delegations.
2) The changes mentioned above also apply to CAP/DH-820. The same rules
f or creating authorizations apply to both DH-810 and to customers creating
authorizations in the CAP.

1 This causes a lot of manual work for datahub
checked every month in connection with invoicing.
Datahub must check that no parties are billed
(vendors and network companies) too much. There are these places of use
hundreds every month. Before each invoicing you have to
to push out the information about those places of use with a report
of the system to know what is billed and what is not.
These places of use must be carried separately by hand
in number of copies per party for invoicing.
If no DH-810 process changes are made (only
The changes proposed in the CAP that correct the part
problems), the effects are as follows:
- datahub invoices the parties for all access points
to whom the authorization has been notified, even if the authorization was
pointless/v wrong
- the customer can also notify the customer of the authorization
sell again even though only those are shown in the customer portal
companies that can be authorized (network companies
regarding the problem will be eliminated by a change in CAP),
because sales information must be visible in all bid requests
for the year of authorizations
- the customer can also choose in v ahingo
energy reporting authority y pin, when
energy authorization places of use should be invoiced
by datahub
- the party can also declare authorizations incorrectly
because there is no blocking for this on behalf of the system
- the new rules would control the fact that they can be given
Very critical change, asap.
The share of CAP implementation is less than half of the total class 1 year.
The share of DH-800 changes is slightly more than the upper limit of size class 1.

CGI FI New Feature: Grid agreement and sales agreement
handled differently after cancellation with reason AR01
outside balance window
In design document FDCMD.340 in scenario 5 cancellation with reason AR01
outside balance window it is described that previous sales agreement is not
restored after the cancellation. DH-341-3 message is sent to previous supplier
and they can submit a new agreement for the previous customer after the period
during which the canceled agreement is valid in datahub. The previous grid
agreement however is restored.
The grid agreement should be handled like the sales agreement on the accounting
point so previous grid agreement should not be restored and the same end date
should be given to the grid agreement. If the previous supplier submits a new sales
agreement on the ACP, a new grid agreement will be created and confirmed
according to the normal process.
When the contract is retroactively canceled outside the balance window, using
reason code AR01 customer cancellation, the network contract is used in different ways
than a sales contract. Let's change the functionality so that the network contract
should be treated like the sales contract for the place of use, so earlier
the network contract should not be reinstated and the network contract should be given
the same expiry date as for the sales contract. If the previous sell
submits a new sales contract, a new one is created and confirmed
network contract according to the normal process.
The agreement is canceled retrospectively outside of the balance window by using
reason code AR01 (customer cancellation), behaves the grid agreement
dif f erently than sales agreement. Change f unctionality so that grid agreement is
handled similarly as the sales agreement on the accounting point. Thus prev ious
grid agreement shall not be restored valid and grid agreement shall get the same end
date as f or sales agreement. If previous supplier notifies new sales agreement,
the new grid agreement will be created and confirmed according to the normal

CGI FI - Configuration Update: Grid agreement might get
wrong end date af ter cancellation with reason AR01 outside the
balance window and no previous agreements
In design document FD.CMD.340 scenario 7 after cancellation of the sales
agreement with reason AR01 outside the balance window and no previous
agreements it is described that the canceled agreement remains valid during the
period from the original start date of the now canceled Sales/Balance Agreement
until the cancellation reporting date (i.e. today).  After the cancellation DH-341-2
is forwarded to the DSO and they are expected to cancel the corresponding grid
agreement.
In the design (3.7.4.1.2.7) it also says that the grid agreement remains valid during
the period from the original start date of the now canceled Grid Agreement until
the cancellation reporting date (i.e. today). So if the DSO does not cancel their
grid agreement on the same day as the sales agreement is cancelled, grid
agreement gets a different end date than the sales agreement on the accounting
point. This leads to DSO and supplier invoicing the same customer from different
periods.
The grid agreement should be ended on the same date as the sales agreement if

CGI FI/NL New feature: Virtual production unit is not
generated for future generation type changes
Virtual production units are not generated in cases where DSO has changed
generation type of the production and sales agreement for the acp is done
afterwards for the period where the "old" generation type is still active.
At present only the active generation type of the acp is the start date of the
sales agreement is taken into account when creating the virtual production unit.
Also possible changes in the production type in the future (after the start date of
the sales agreement) should be taken into account. So a VPUs should be
generated also for that production type.
Virtual production units are composed within DH-122 and DH-311 processes:
- DH-122:
 New v PU is created when production type of an accounting point is updated
if there is also a valid sales agreement on the same date.
- DH-311
 New v PU is created with the active production type pe on the start date of the
sales agreement
At present possible changes in production type in the future or sales agreements
starting later than the update of the accounting point are not taken into account.
There have been cases that v PU is not composed in certain retrospectiv e
changesand it has not been possible to report that production to eSett without
the v PU.
Possible changes in the production type (after the start date of the new sales
agreement) or sales agreements starting later on in the future (after the update
of the accounting point takes ef f ect) should be taken into account. Creation of
the virtual production unit should take those also into account and possible
create multiple v PUs at once.
The virtual production unit is created by the DH-122 and DH-311 processes
where:
- DH-122:
 A new PU is created in connection with the update of the production method at the site of use,
if the place of use has a valid sales contract at the same time.
- DH-311
 A new PU is created in connection with the creation of a new sales contract,
valid at the place of use on the start date of the sales contract
production method below.
At the moment, possible changes in the production method of the place of use or
sales contracts starting later than the date of the production method are not taken into account
in the creation of virtual production companies.
In connection with certain retroactive updates and changes, there is no PU
was born and it has prevented the reporting of this production in the direction of eSett.
Possible changes in the production method (changes at the beginning of the sales contract
after) or sales contracts starting later (start of production method
to be updated later) virtual ones should be taken into account
in the creation of production units. Possibly there would be virtual production units
if necessary, create several at once, taking into account future changes

Finnish government is renewing the personal identifications to ensure that ID's

Fingrid is suggesting that CGI should add the following validation
rule to DH-220 ev ents:
- limit requests that have over 1 month time period
- F08 messages should not have that limitation if there is 1..n

The message is checked in advance before it is sent to the internal data hub
processing in Datahub is able to limit requests for time series data by a certain amount
in the distribution network area. Accuracy level of 15-minute time series data datahub 2.0
v version still requires a separate implementation for the constraint.
This validation of the message upf ront before sending it into Kx.  With this CMS
can restrict the time period of requests f or timeseries data based on just the
gridarea (DSO). 15 minutes time series data resolution in datahub 2.0 requires still
implementation of this restriction separately.

Accounting point information available for authorized parties

A third party would be able to receive a list of all the accounting points of its customer based on the customer's business ID.
Could this be implemented as some sort of request, which then returns a list?

2 The customer might have many (e.g. 100) accounting
points and the amount of accounting points may vary. A
third party should provide serv ice to the customer but
might be missing some accounting points if the number
of customer's accounting points has increased but the
customer has not informed the third party. So, some of
the accounting points remain out of the scope of the
serv ice unintentionally, and the party does not have any
v isibility in datahub to notice the missing accounting
A party needs to know both business ID of the customer and
the accounting point ID in order to find the needed accounting

Authorization to be given via the customer Portals of the third
parties in addition to the datahub end customer Portal
In addition to datahub CAP, the authorization could be given in the third party's system/customer portal. The issue is that Fingrid Datahub needs to be able to verify that the end
customer has given their consent and is aware that they are giving such a permission to the third party. It could be further examined, whether it would be possible to have some
sort of a redirection/link f rom the third party's Portal to datahub CAP, so that the authorization could be giv en via third party's Portal but Fingrid Datahub could still be able to
verify that the end customer has given their consent.

Closer to real-time metering data availability in datahub
At the moment, the metering data is delivered to datahub once per day (according to the Gov ernment Decree on the Settlement and metering of electricity supplies (767/2021)).
The decree does not prohibit a more frequent delivery, but in practice the data is mostly delivered once a day. A more frequent delivery would require changes to the current one

frequently to datahub.

The seller canceled the contract retroactively due to AR04, new
my y jä wants to start the contract from the original
from the moving date
We have read the instructions dealing with cancellations in the Sähkö vähmättäsmarkts business processes in the datahub document and other instructions. We have not found an example
about how to act in the following situation:
Seller A retroactively cancels his sale due to AR04. The sale has started e.g. 8 March 2022 and the seller cancels the contract at the beginning of 23 March 2022. Datahub's sales data remains valid
balance sheet information for the period before the cancellation date. After this, seller B wants to start selling from the customer's original moving date on March 8, 2022.
Because there are sales in the destinationn A sells residual data between March 8 and March 23, 2022, seller B does not get his own contract through directly on the start date of March 8, 2022. In the situation, the customer's contract
has therefore started as a move and seller B is also a new seller at the place of use. How should the different parties act in this situation? In this situation, is the locking process not applicable,
through which the sellers could agree on a retroactive sales start date?
We have received information from a seller that the network company should inform FG about the removal of seller A's residual data from the data hub after receiving information from seller B that
Seller B wants to start selling on the customer's moving date, March 8. from Is this the right course of action, does the network company have to act as an intermediary for the new seller B
based on email? After all, the network has no information, for example, whether seller A wants to use his invoicing right.
Such situations are relatively common, and we would like your advice on how V Erko should act in these situations.

I am connected to CAP:
you have set up a great new service. It's nice when
electrical information is in one place and hopefully longer
time than some electricity companies offer them. A few ideas
however, I would have offered the current one for the development of service life
the shape doesn't quite suit my needs.
- The graph shows a period of a year at most
v dominates the monthly outlook. This would be a good thing to praise
to a maximum of six years, so that you could compare the long term
develop, for example, when making housing transactions and
when changing electricity usage habits.
- In CSV export, it would be nice if you could choose
to complete the summation to the hour/day/week/month level.
Many, including myself, are not Excel wizards and do not know how
In Excel, sum, for example, to the level of months, from which a long-term comparison
would succeed. When you tell Excel to draw a graph of 2 million
line up and pull time into a knot.
- A year's worth of data seems to be around 10
in a second, which is a perfectly tolerable time when it's big
about the amount of data. With a larger, six-year, amount of data
it is worth considering additional data sources where the data would be ready
summed up instead of the current 15/60 min, for example
day/week level.

Control report to the network company selling residual data/contract status

We need a control report for the network company to compare whether our and DH's contract information and especially vendor information are up-to-date. Now we are looking for measurement data
as a reminder, which appears instead of customer data in the measurement data system (The time series was not reported because the sale is not valid for us, it is in DH).

sales company but is valid in datahub).

Unnecessary customer data deviations; when will you come to datahub
field content validations according to the data standard and Titan?
Examples of different types of data and daily quantity data:
1. By the way, we and datahub have the same phone number, but datahub's number is without the country code (+358501234567/0501234567). According to the data standard, the phone number
the allowed format is according to ITU-T E.164 (+358501234567). About 100 of these useless messages come every day.
2. Customer house letter AS we have as. There are numerous variations of this, there are about ten of these messages every day.
3. Information written in capital letters: the personal customer's name is otherwise the same, but written entirely in capital letters in the text from the data hub, e.g.  AKU ANKKA we have Aku in the information
Duck. The street name also has addresses written in capital letters.
4. foreign addresses; In the assa v alidation in Tita, the entire address was placed in the street name field excluding the postal code and post office information. The street number was set to 0.
Now the addresses come as they come.
In the Datahub 1.0 implementation project, Titta validated the supplied data and based on that, the parties made data corrections that required resources.  On Säti days, the group work was deep
worry about the erosion of datahub data and the presentation of the work we do. Some of the parties update everything without checking their system. Some have acquired their system
handling unnecessary messages, e.g. robotics.
The Säti days group was unanimous that the validation of the information sent to the data hub should be done by the data hub, and not by the validation and rejection of incorrect transactions
every party receiving information from the data hub.  The current model causes an unnecessary added burden for the parties.
During the Datahub 1.0 implementation project, the lack of validation was reported, and it was also mentioned that validations would be added to the datahub later. I can't find a schedule for this, e.g.
From Datahub 2.0 material. When will the validation be implementedto datahub?
Limitation of unnecessary customer data discrepancies with data validations f or
data fields according to the data standard and Titta data migration.
Examples for different types of data and daily number of information:
1. Phone number is the same in market party sy Stem and datahub but in datahub
without the country code (+358501234567/0501234567). According to the data
standard phone number's allowed in f ormat is ITU-T E.164 (+358501234567).
Unnecessary messages because of this daily about ten.
2. Customer house letter "AS" in our sy Stem "as". That has sev eral v ariations
and causes about ten messages daily.
3. Capital letters written data: end customer name is same in market party
sy Stem and datahub but the one coming f rom datahub is written with capital
letters, e.g. DONALD DUCK, in market party sy Stem Donald Duck. Also in the
street names with capital letters.
4. Foreign addresses; Titta's validation for street name field had full address
without postal number and post of f ice information. Street number got zero (0).
Now the address updates can giv e what ev er.
Datahub 1.0 commissioning project with Titta v alidated the deliv Ered data and
market parties used a lot of time to make data correct. Now there is a big worry
that data quality goes down and the big ef f ort done the go-liv e is lost. The
market party sy stems work dif f erently , some sy Stem do not validate any thing
and some systems use e.g. robotics.

The content of the previous e-mail message sent to the seller
develops p
Suggested fix:
The seller who has been approved for the start of another seller's retroactive contract (DH-311-14 transaction) can receive an e-mail with the following notification:
"The reported sales contract with the effective date 2022-03-30T21:00:00Z for the location XXXXXXXXXXXX could not be created due to validation errors. Your sales contract
YYYYYYYY continues at the place of use unchanged."
In the current situation, the background is generally that the seller who announced the retroactive agreement has announced the same agreement several times and fulfilled all of them
requested additional information (DH-311-11) in the user interface. When the current seller of the place of use approves all these retroactive contract initiations (=for every notification there is
the current seller's own DH-311-14 event is born), only one retroactive contract is approved and the rest are caught in the "validation error". The validation error starts
an e-mail message that in this way makes the seller who has accepted the retroactive contract believe that their contract is still going on.
Development of the email sent to the previous supplier.
The email content (the one sent to the previous supplier) is misleading if new
(supplier that notifies the retrospective sales agreement) supplier has notified
sev eral retrospectiv e agreement to the datahub. There can be many of these
and alway s those require additional explanation that "ignore this email content,
y our agreement has been ended in real".
E.g. message: "Notif ied sales agreement start date DD on accounting point X
cannot be created because of validation error. Sales contract Y continues
unchanged on the accounting point. But the sales agreement is not valid on the
user interface. Incorrect information?
Notified retroactive sale agreement with effective date 2022-03-
30T21:00:00Z could not be created for user location XXXXXXXXXXXX due to validation errors
year out. Your sales contract YYYYYYYY continues at the place of use
unchanged, or the second retroactive contract notification has already ended
due to. Please check the situation with the user.

CAP Energy reporting
Could Datahub's Energy Reporting be developed in such a way that Datahub could be viewed at once, e.g. History data for two years. Now it would appear that you can view only
12-month period data. As a customer, it is often interesting to compare e.g. data from the same period of the previous year. E.g. Last year and current year. Or now t May 2022 and
previous May 2021. Therefore, e.g. it would be nice to have the consumption of the previous 24 months listed consecutively. Datahub would be significantly better than electricity sellers in this regard

Search for measurement data to show changes
Would it be possible to change the search view of the measurement data immediately to the initial screen. It would be important to see the address right away in the initial view and not just a long string of numbers.
The search view for measurement data in the data hub is clumsy. Only a fraction of the searched series will be visible at the bottom, and examining the measurement data is just browsing/scrolling. Could you
condense that view from above so that the fields/cells at the top are even next to each other or closer together so that there is more space down there for those series of hours
to be seen. Or is it possible to make such a change that those series of hours would open in a completely different window, which would then be the size of the entire screen, that would be the best option. Here
in the view, the information of the upper part is from the view of the lower part of the hawk, and the view of the subject itself is minimal. And this is not helped by the settings of the computer screen.

Datahub user interface - Get measurement data - XLS printout
the randomness of the readings and other fun things
In general, with such a 3rd party as a business entity, is there any Functional area in this system?
- The user interface often gives an error message if you try to view measurement data with a resolution other than the default PT1H, i.e. h-level. "An error occurred during
processing of the submitted request."
- XLS prints Work completely randomly.
With H-level readings: the readings on the XLS output must be multiplied by a random hidden coefficient to the readings shown in the interface. This coefficient is not shown to the user
in any information or printout of the place of use, i.e. it must be noted, calculated and processed by the readings itself. In the CSV data, the readings are the same size as the user interface.
E.g. from a couple of different kp
PT1H h level:
Xkatu 5, City
Place of employment XXXXXXXXX
Timestamp: 21/06/2022 0.00
Reading from the user interface or CSV: 0.06
With XLS output: 0.00416666666666667
P1M monthly level:
Ytie 3, City
Place of employment XXXXXXXXXXXX
Attached is a picture of the user interface and the XLS printout. For these, you can't even use a multiplier, because some of the monthly readings are the same as the one used and some of the readings are something
nothing else without any kind of logic. Some of the readings show a comma as the decimal separator, and some dot.

Could the operation of the hub be changed by connecting the under-construction guests? E.g. in such a way that the start date of the contract is changed only if the contract has been under construction for the entire contract
v tenure? In that case, old contracts that have already been invoiced would not be changed? In other words, if the contract was in force before the contract was changed to under construction status,
changing the status back to connected would not change the start date of the contract. If, on the other hand, the contract has entered into force after the contract has been changed to under construction status, the contract
the start day will be changed like now. Is the determining factor the date of contract notification or the start date of the contract, I don't know which would be better.
Can datahub be changed in "under contraction" states connect? E.g. contract
start date is changed only if accounting point has been under construction
before the accounting point was changed to under construction state and the state
change to connected would not change agreement start date. If the agreement
has become valid af ter the accounting point has been changed to the under
construction state, agreement start date can be changed as current rules say.
Is the ruling f actor the agreement notification date or contract start date?

Reasonableness is needed when it comes to software
Hello! Since the Hub was put into use, companies have started to receive customer data updates. In some of the updates, no information has changed, but they still need to be checked
for example. However, we don't have the resources to do all the steps manually, and that wouldn't be the purpose, and for that reason, we don't update the customer information.
through the machine and we check them afterwards as soon as we can. Attached is the case of an example customer, so that you understand that this has to be achieved somehow
develop more sensibly. We currently have a valid network contract with this customer for two locations, one of which we also sell electricity to.
There is an external salesperson at the second location. However, these address updates may come to us via the customer from completely different sellers or networks, and not us
get access to the root cause, i.e., which party sends this false information to the hub. In the example case, a mailbox without PL text. Thinking about the future, I need to see the hub,
that from which companies information flows to other companies. At Emme companies, we can start calling all of Finland's electricity companies and find out who doesn't write PL correctly. Hub's income
after this, as a manager, it's really frustrating to watch our customer service staff here doing this kind of really frustrating repair work, which has increased since the use of the tube
after considerably compared to the former time. Are we really trained to a high level for this kind of work? The answer is "it isn't". This needs to be fixed throughout the industry
from system changes. In companies, we have to spend our time on really productive work that benefits our company.
The end customer has a valid grid agreement at the moment in two accounts
points and we have a sales agreement to one of those. The other accounting point
has another supplier.

Could you please add to the connection requests requested by the seller
check that the connection request cannot be sent unless
a broken copy has not been sent from the place of use
E.g. cp XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX the connection request has come earlier than later, now there is going to be an outage.
You can also see switching requests, although there is no disconnection request at all. For example XXXXXXXXXXXX.
And e.g. in cases of moving, the Seller receives connection requests, even if there is no interruption. (The same applies to them during the Prodat period as well).
The problem is that the events remain open in our datahub because we cannot delete them ourselves.
Can you add validation check f or connect requests by supplier: connect

E.g. accounting point XXX disconnect request has arrived on earlier day that
there is now disconnection planned to happen. There is also an available connection

CAP is being developed as a proposal for a data hub
- "Download file" gives the current day as the default end date. Almost all companies have about a day's delayed data collection for the year, now there is a useless error message
(I assume it's because of that) when searching for data. It could be ready a couple of days before the end date by default.
- It would be extremely convenient if customers could give data access for a limited time to anyone registered for the service. Now third-party access is quite difficult
for small and medium-sized companies and third parties do not always need continuous authorization.

Contract information / third party / party authorization
The service provider (XXXX & YYYY) cannot see the seller's contract information, even though as the service provider responsible for the customer's electricity procurement, we have a full power of attorney for the customer
to contract information. This leads to the fact that we still have to inquire by e-mail about the basic information of the current contract from the sellers, such as deadlines and
terms of termination.
Contract information should also be released to third parties. Alternatively, Datahub's "party authorization" function should be developed so that the seller can authorize a third party
of the party to contract information.
Serv ice prov ider cannot see supplier's agreement data, ev en as end customer's
electricity purchase responsibility serv ice prov ider we should have full access to
agreement data. This causes cases where we need to request basic agreement
data f rom supplier by email, as if agreement is fixed term and cancellation
rules.
Agreement information shall be released also to third parties. Another alternative e
is that datahub's market party authorization shall be developed so that supplier
can give authorization to third parties for the agreements' data.

Network available processed termination event
The network cannot process the termination event, because the contract has now ended as a result of a new move. If the new move announced to the workplace is cancelled, this agreement
would erroneously return to force, even though the termination event has been notified to it separately. It would be good to take this into account in development.
(E.g. We ask to remove from the site XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX the open transaction from the termination of the online contract YYYYYYYY for the date 2022-08-30 00, please.

Developed proposal: enable fuse size 10xZZZ
We have requested fuse size 10x3x100 and 10x3x1250 for the customer information system from the system supplier. It is not possible to add these, since Datahub does not accept anything but
y one number to that fuse, e.g. 9xZZZ. The powers of the connections are increasing and it would be necessary to have this fuse. Is it possible to also enable 10xZZZ initials
fuses in Datahub?
Possibility to have f use size 10xZZZZ
It is not possible to add new f use sizes (10x3x100 and 10x3x1250) into the
customer information sy Stem as datahub accepts only the f use size with one
number in the name e.g. 9xZZZ. The power of accounting point connections
increase and the new f use sizes are necessary. Can datahub accept f use sizes
starting with "10xZZZ"?
Changing the allowed fuse size to “{99x}99x9999” (currently
“{9x}9x9999”).
Question: Can two-digit values ​​be freely allowed (up to 99) or
is there a reason to limit the e.g. presented y to 10?

Check with Datahub for correctness of surname/name information
I would like this matter to be discussed in the development group, because I myself do not have a direct answer to what kind of check should be done on the data hub. We receive
now weekly data protection notices that the customer's name information has become incorrect according to the update from the data hub. Setting up these cases is very difficult
and unpleasant for the customer. In the background, these are either a Dh111-2 made with incorrect information (the customer's address and name do not match) or the conclusion of a new contract with the wrong
with a name/family name combination.  I would also like to discuss in the development group what kind of checks could be added to the end of the data hub to prevent customer data
of reckless transformation v wrong. At this time, there are no reviews in the data hub at all, and when one party makes a mistake, the billing of several operators is suddenly messed up.
Datahub to v alidate personal id/name information match.
We are receiv ing Weekly data priv acy notifications that customer name

The root cause is incorrect DH -112 (end customer personal id and name do not

Possibility to update new SAG without EC.AGR. 215 (reason
for or agreement start interpreted incorrectly )
There needs to be cured the problem with
-interpreting the reason f or agreement starts on the accounting point and
-possibility for the same DDQ to update new SAG without EC.AGR. 215 (reason for agreementstart interpreted incorrectly?)
There is a v alid grid agreement f or the customer whose new sales agreement is being rejected (because DSO has not canceled the grid agreement just yet) but the v alid sales
agreement on the ACP is for a completely different customer.
Submitting a new agreement fails incorrectly because of v alidation rule EC.AGR.215 (reason f or agreement start interpreted incorrectly ?)
Tested in SAT01, version 1.9.0. Found this problem when re-testing PTASK0010150.
The test case simulates a situation where the customer wants to postpone the start date of the agreement.
In these situations it's quite common that the supplier cancels the original agreement and submits a new agreement f or the same customer with dif f erent start date bef ore DSO
reacts to the cancellation
1. I created a new accounting point XXXXXXXXXXXX and submitted a fixed term agreement f or customer YYYYYYYYY starting f rom 3.7. Grid agreement was also confirmed.
2. Then I submitted a new agreement for different supplier and different customer (customer YYYYYYYYC) starting from 1.8. Agreement was accepted because it is a move in
and corresponding grid agreement was also confirmed.
3. I canceled the later sales agreement (customer YYYYYYYYYC's agreement) with cancellation reason AR02. Corresponding grid agreement was not canceled before the next one
step.
4. I tried to submit a new sales agreement f or the same customer (customer YYYYYYYYC) starting from 1.9.  Agreement is rejected because of the validation rule EC.AGR.215
(If an Accounting Point has a v alid f ixed-term Sales Agreement (on Start of Occurrence) where the customer type is "Consumer" and the latest f ixed term period is less than or
equal to 2 years, then a Change of Supplier cannot be reported).
Rejection makes no sense because the agreement that is rejected has a completely different customer than on the agreement on step 1. See attachment "Agreement rejection" f or
error code receiv ed when testing and attachment "sales agreement" f or current sales agreement's information.

Invalid hetu and DH-340 process
This topic has been thought about quite a lot recently when data protection observation tickets have been discussed..
One party received just such a comment "Thank you for the message. I would like to make sure that when we send the DH311-1 message, and the customer information is updated accordingly, the incorrect
behind the personal ID. Is the cancellation of our sale (Reason code Seller canceled) enough to cancel the incorrectly updated information from all parties, if the incorrect ID is
someone else's ID?"
So, at that point, is the cancellation made by the party himself sufficient for the contract with the wrongful benefit? Or do we have to start checking from each party
separately, do you now have the correct customer information in your system? What happens to those customer data in the hub if the contract is canceled by the party, will it remain?
incorrect customer data still valid, i.e. one of the parties should still correct them on the day?
Comment on the topic:
I read through that DH-340 design back then and there is no mention of the fact that the customer information updated through the creation of the contract would be canceled as it were. So it stays
to take into account what has been wrongly reported, if that customer has been in the hub at the time of the report and this DH-311 has updated that information. Good point, you should think of a model for that
instructions on how to operate. The seller of the canceled contract does not necessarily know how the information was in the hub before the contract was announced. But it can't be that we either
let's go find out about them. Those cancellations go automatically.
Incorrect personal id and DH-340 process
DH-311-1 message updates the customer information with incorrect personal id.
Is it enough that our sales canceling (reason code supplier cancelled) cancels
incorrect updated information f rom all parties if the incorrect personal id is some
other person's personal id?
If the seller cancels the announced contract at the wrong moment, it should be deleted
it now creates customer information.

Event DH-344 is pointless
In the energy industry development group, event DH-344 Refusal to return the network contract has been discussed.
The event is a response to the seller's refusal to return the contract. ET's development team saw that the DH-344 event is pointless, because the network company should never decide
online contract only for the year that the place of use remains unsold.
I will create transaction DH-344 from the application. Regarding the return of the seller's contract

connect to the internal netting of the place of use Datahub 2.0:
We have sites where the production and consumption location is open
in the names of different customers. This is the customer's wish and ET
confirmed that this can be done. In these situations, the customer does not
necessarily hope for netting. How should one act regarding these?
Will v Erkko declare these in any case
as a parallel workplace? The network doesn't necessarily know
when a new production location appears, that it does not
let the same customer come to the place of consumption. I mean, how
these should be managed so that the company still gets production
and consumption series separately? How should the seller act?
I tried to interpret this from the documents, but I was not sure.
Only for the energy company, "no netting" is allowed in certain cases
situations? For example, in what situation can v Erkko choose (DH-122-
2/DH-122-3) "no netting"? Only with the energy company
ky see?
The seller's DH-124 transaction is not mentioned in the 2.0 docker, so
According to the seller, there will be no energy company or netting
join v i things?
Somehow I remember that, at least for the time being, I can't
three series, production, consumption and possibly
of netting and v oi v alita, but will this change in DH 2.0?
We also have customers who have a contract for both production and
to the place of consumption, but you still don't want netting. In addition
there are customers with whom we can only contract
regarding the production site, the contract. How netting works in it
Datahub accounting point internal net calculation:
We have accounting points that have production and consumption accounting
points on dif f erent end customers name. That is customer wish and Energy
Industry has confirmed that it is possible. In these kind of cases customer
does not want to have a net calculation. How should it work? Is the grid company
going to inform those any way as parallel accounting points? Grid company
does not necessarily know when a new production accounting point appears that it
will not have the same customer as on the consumption accounting point. How the
can supplier get separate time series for production and consumption? How
supplier should act? Documentation did not answer on that. Only in energy
community case "no netting" is allowed on certain cases? E.g. in which case
grid can choose (DH-122-2/DH-122-3) "no netting"? Only in case of energy
community?
Supplier DH-124 ev ent is not mentioned in the 2.0 documentation, thus energy
community or netting data is not a part of supplier message?
I remember that at the moment supplier gets 3 time series, production,
consumption and possible netting and can choose, is this going to change in
2.0? We have also customers that have an agreement for both production and
consumption accounting point, but do not want to have netting. There is also
customers that want to make an agreement only for production. How netting works
are those cases or isn't it possible to make those kind of agreements?
24/03/2022 Calculations
CSUSE0016057
2 The network can delete these items if it wishes
parallelism, in which case that netting is not done. Sure
this would require that the network has information that these
netting is not desired for the places of use. Not at all
so far, datahub does not support a transaction with which the seller can leave
this is reported, so this must be requested separately from the networks
by being directly connected to them.
The network itself cannot report that "no netting" status
datahub infers the parallelism of that state of use
and the production device connected to the production location
maximum power (sum of small production devices
maximum power less than 100kVA). So v Erkko doesn't
report that netting status to datahub.
The sellers are not really related to the companies or netting
report information to the datahub, but these are the doors of the networks
data controlled by you. My y jä gets these made by v Erko
changes as temporary updates of location information (DH-122-
2).
At the moment, datahub does not calculate netting, i.e. from the datahub
there will be one time series per place of use. In the future, my y jä
get both measured (DH-211) and possible netted

Develop a proposal: for the role of salesperson with the client's authorization
the same access rights as the 3rd party
With the customer's authorization in the role of a seller, the party operating must receive measurement data and other information over the same long period of time and in the same way as the 3rd party receives. In the present
the restriction has no basis, puts the seller in an unfair position with the sales consultants and causes unnecessary "fuss" when, for example, a 3rd party has to be established,
whose role certain t functions are performed.
This should be sent to the development team for quick processing.
Supplier role should have the same authorizations for data as for third party.
With customer authorization the supplier should get metering data and other data
f rom same time period as third party gets. The current limitation has no
arguments and get supplier f or unf are situation with sales Consult and causes
unnecessary tricks, when e.g. there is a need to establish a third party role (f or
supplier) that then can make those actions.

Developed proposal: measurement data delivery requirements from networks
Although datahub sends reminders to the networks about the lack of measurement data, apparently they do not care much about the comments, because data is sometimes significantly missing.
Maybe it is thought that it is enough to fix the information by the end of the month. XXX bills significantly for other periods than full months and absences
causes inconvenience in invoicing and a lot of extra work to get the measurement data in order. It would be necessary to plan how Fingrid/datahub could get the required measurement data more powerfully
delivery.
Measurement data reminders will be sent after the 1.9.0 version update
to send 30 days retroactively instead of the current 14 days. This in part
helps the network detect the remaining gaps in the measurement data.
In addition, a reminder of measurement data sent once a month will be added
from a longer period of time. The period to be reminded will be one year
retroactive until. This contributes to increasing the network information that is missing from the data hub
measurement data.

The DH-311-4 is also forwarded to the same seller that did
immigration to the place of parallel use
Would it be possible to add the same rule for the DH-311-4 to the hub
as in the case of DH-311-3?  “Is there a move-in
the reporting seller is the same as the seller of the parallel access location?"
If so, no DH-311-4 will be sent.
A few examples have come up in production where contracts for parallel locations have been made at slightly different times.
E.g. moving into a place of consumption on 25.7. and move-in to the parallel production site on 29.7.
The latter move-in has caused the message DH-311-4 to the consumption location, even though both have the same seller and the same customer.
Examples: consumption kp GSRN: xxxxxxxxxx and its parallel kp y y y y y y y y y y y .
DH-311-4 is transmitted also to the same supplier who made mov e-in f or parallel
accounting point.
Could datahub add same rule to the DH-311-4 transmission as there is in DH-
311-3 transmission? Is the supplier that notifies the mov e-in same as supplier
of the parallel accounting point? If it is, then there shall not be sent DH-311-4.
There are examples in the production that there have been agreements for or
parallel account point is dif f erent time.
E.g. mov e-in to the consumption accounting point is 25.7. and mov e-in to the
production accounting point is 29.7.The later mov e-in has caused message DH-
311-4 to the consumption accounting point ev en both hav e same supplier and

FG educational request, Reports: Webinar request and
comments/questions/requests
we would like to have those DH reports. Currently
their use is still quite low, when their
the possibilities of use have not yet been thoroughly explored
in any v topic. On the main level there is a list of them and driving directions,
but the idea, why are you in any way (where
put into use) is still quite unclear and for that year
we certainly don't even know how to use it to that extent
what would be reasonable. On this basis, we have collected ao
questions/comments/suggestions.
• Balance sheet initial data control report:
    o where is the 'internal balance sheet ID' - code list?
    o For which year the report does not receive the information more directly, e.g
GSRN no. my ös .sd file and GLN my y ice ID .md
        to a file?
   o In what ways are the things found in this report going to waste
capt?
• Balance sheet quality and location control panel:
   o we would need the possibility to also limit a longer time interval to this search -> kpt at any desired interval another series of classes
        with the status "does not exist", "missing" or "uncertain". For example, before invoicing for the monthly shift, it would always be possible to apply
        the whole ed month or before the balance miscalculation the whole time interval to be calculated.
   o Possibility to export e.g. 'does not exist', 'missing' and 'incorrect' lists to Excel
   o NOBS objects - you must get a list of the different statuses per kp.no
• In general, more detailed instructions regarding reports:
   o it would be good for the instructions to explain in more detail what the report could/should be used for and how it can be best used and
        based on that, it can be decided, at least, which would be the kind of reports that should be looked at.
   o possibly y Leine's webinar, where only the reports would be reviewed at a more detailed level
• The reports should be such that they serve network/sales tasks more directly, i.e. direct links from the report to
        up to the level and not only the top-level knowledge that there is a place of use where there is a problem
   o e.g. Number of Accounting points -> the list directly also includes the kpnro so you don't need it separately yet Places of use
        to search and filter the report, e.g. if someone is connected but not measured.
   or e.g. the same Number of Load Curv e Accounting Points -> now there will be a number, but it would be good to have this as well
        listing what is ko kpt
   o Listings of places of use with reports or by opening them directly to Excel (no intermediate editing)
   o Drilling down into the information would be easier if DH av saved several tabs so that the searched report does not disappear, if e.g.
        looks at some information per kp (e.g. if you occasionally look at kp per Accounting Points without
        Balance Supplier)
• bug: if you look at the reports of one network and switch to another network, you still get the results of the original network for the reports.
        Logging out and logging in again is required before the correct reports are displayed.
Reports:
 Balance calculation input control report:
 - report does not include GSRN number in .sd f Ile and GLN supplier id in .md
f Ile
 Balance quality and location control panel:
 - possiblity to limit longer period of time to the seach -> accounting points for or
selected period of time series data
 - search with status "null", "missing" or "uncertain", e.g. when checking the
inv oicing monthly
 - possibility to export only "null", "missing" or "uncertain" data lists into MS
Excel
 - NOBS by accounting point id according to the different statuses
- Link from the report to the accounting point data details.
- e.g. Number of Accounting points -> list shall contain accounting point ids to
av oid run separate accounting point report or f ilter if accounting point is
connected but not metered.
- e.g. Number of Load Curv e Accounting Points -> now only number of
accounting points but also hav e accounting point ids
- accounting point lists on reports or directly to MS Excel (no need to modify in
between)
- drilling down to data would be easier if datahub had more sheets for reports
and same time possibility to look at accounting point data (e.g. if checking on
accounting point lev el report "Accounting Points without Balance Supplier")
Drilling into the information would be easier if DH av had more tabs like that

The future seller's cancellation would not supersede the previous one
contract if it is already signed by the seller

When the future seller cancels the seller, the previous agreement would not come into force in the event that it has already been decided by the seller himself to the customer's preference
day. this now creates quite a mess for those construction companies when they want the contract to end on a certain date and then the future seller cancels
so everything has to be reviewed very carefully to see if we wanted to end this now -> the agreement will be enforced and then decided again on the same day it was originally scheduled for

The need for reporting data e
The need for reporting data e
From the network company's point of view, it would be good to know, in this energy situation, at least the validity periods of the fixed-term sales contracts of one's own network area (and the whole of Finland)
at the sum level if information cannot be provided at the location level
• fixed-term contracts that ended monthly / daily during 2022
• new fixed-term contracts that started during 2022 / extensions of expired fixed-term contracts
• Continuation of terminated fixed-term contracts valid for the time being a
• Fixed-term contracts will expire in 2023
• The added value of the report would be generated if sales contracts were grouped according to annual consumption, e.g. Contracts using over and under 10,000 kWh and number of copies
From the point of view of the network company, it would be useful to gain visibility into the sales contract situation of its own network area and the customers' situation in the changed price situation.
The network company would be able to anticipate the cost pressure that would arise for its customers in the changed market situation and prepare for different scenarios with regard to its own receivables when
an overall view of the market situation would exist.
On the other hand, information about the customers' overall situation would also help to consider the effect of different load control measures on the customers
Reporting needs:
From the grid company point of view it would be good to know in this kind of energy
business situation at least own grid area (and whole Finland) fixed term sales
contracts v alidation times are sum lev el if it is not possible to deliv ery that
information on accounting point level:
- on y ear 2022 monthly / daily ended fixed term agreements
- on y ear 2022 new fixed term agreements / ended fixed term agreements next
step agreements
- ended fixed term agreements next step open ended agreements (not fixed
term)
- on y ear 2023 ending fixed term agreements
- the report would be more valid if sales agreements were grouped by annual
consumption e.g. agreement using over and under 10,000 kWh and number of
those.
From grid company perspectiv e it would be v aluable to get visibility on own
MGA's sales agreement status and customer status on changing energy prices
situation.
Grid company could thus predict f or customer cost price is changing
market situation and prepare f or dif f erent scenarios f rom own debt point of view

Contracts concluded with the bulk process are not the same
ended with a DH-331 event (or DH-311, for which
included ending date) when the ending date started
the new sales contract is cancelled. We had fun with it
in the understanding that the contract concluded with bulk is exactly the same
stronger than decided by the norm process. So go ahead DH-
340 definition must be changed so that the condition "Prev ious
Sales Agreement did not already have an end date that was
explicitly reported by the Previous Supplier using the (DH-311)
creation process or (DH-331) termination process." must be added
When a sales agreement is canceled (DH-341), previous agreements ended
using a bulk process are not handled the same way as previous agreements
that have been ended with DH-331 or DH-311. DH-341 does not Restore a
previous agreement "if the previous Sales Agreement already had an end date
(followed by gap ornot) that was explicitly reported by the Previous Supplier
using the (DH-311) creation process or (DH-331) termination process."
This also needs to include the bulk process so that agreements end with that
are not restored.
When the DH-341 process (cancellation of sales contract) is concluded
will the previous sales contract be reinstated, concluded with the bulk process
contracts must be processed in the same way as DH-331 or DH-311
concluded contracts, i.e. they will not be reinstated.
When determining whether a sales agreement should be restored in DH-341,
previous agreements that have been ended using a bulk process need to be
handled the same way as agreements ended using DH-331 or DH-311 (purposely
ended), i.e. not restored.

Delivery contract problem:
In the DH-311 process, the past of the place of use is examined
sales contract when assessing whether the place of use changes
contract into a delivery contract or from a delivery contract
as a normal contract. Reasoning does not take into account
information on whether the network contract is in question
network contract related to the delivery contract or not. This
leads to the need for a new one in some situations
the network contract is not correctly concluded in datahub.
The process will be changed so that the reasoning in
the information on the network contract is taken into account.
(Process document) Creation of the online contract:
Datahub determines whether a new network contract is needed from the information in the seller's notice and the current customer and contract situation of the place of use. When it comes to the seller's or
change of contract, a new one is needed
network agreement in those situations where the network agreement in force at the place of use is different
with the customer as a future sales contract. ... Even if the customers on the contracts are the same, a new network contract is also needed if the contracts' "electricity supply contract" fields
you don't answer each other, ...
At the moment, the examination of the "electricity supply agreement" field only takes into account the sales agreement prior to the point of use, and not the information of the network agreement at all. In situations where
the place of use has a network contract at the time the new contract comes into force, but no previous sales contract, this can lead to a conflict between the sales and network contract
in the delivery contract information.
(Process document) Making a grid agreement:
Datahub will decide whether a new grid agreement is necessary based on data
reported by the supplier and on the accounting point's customer and agreement
status at the given time. If the matter concerns a move in, a new grid
agreement is always made. If the matter concerns a change in supplier or
agreement, a new grid agreement is required in those situations where the
v alid
grid agreement f or an accounting point is held by a customer that dif f ers f rom
the customer in the upcoming sales agreement. ... Ev en if the customers of the agreements would match, a new grid agreement is needed if the “deliv ery agreement” attributes of the agreements do not match, ... At the moment, the check on the "deliv ery agreement " f ield only takes into account the previous sales agreement and not the grid agreement. In situations where a new sales agreement is created and there already is a grid agreement but no prev ious sales agreement on the accounting point, this can lead to a mismatch between the sales and the grid agreement's "deliv ery agreement" of the DH-311 process " The review of the "Electricity supply agreement" field must also take into account the network agreement of the place of use: If the place of use has a previous sales agreement, this is used in the review. If there is no previous sales agreement, but a network agreement is found,
the network agreement is used in the review.
In addition, a statement is needed about the currently existing contract pairs
(sales & network) that have a conflict in the delivery agreement information. The check on the "delivery agreement" field in the DH-311 process must also
take into account the grid agreement on the accounting point:
If the accounting point has a previous sales agreement, the check is done using
that. If there is no previous sales agreement but a grid agreement exists, the
check is done using the grid agreement.
In addition, a report is needed on the existing agreement pairs (sales & grid) that
have a mismatch in the delivery agreement information.10.3.2022 Contract process

1 Due to the incorrect operation of this datahub, this is causing significant inconvenience to customers, since the only way around is to terminate the network contract
and then conclude a new contract with the seller.
This This causes situations where the customer does not see his/her consumption data in the online services until the seller can re-enter the contract. This is particularly emphasized when it is hoped that the new seller will start selling even in retroactive situations, where the current seller's operations end. In addition to the fact that this issue is visible to end customers, this error is really annoying, so since the introduction, we have "tricked" thousands and thousands of contracts in a roundabout way and in some cases even needed the operator's help, because sometimes the network contract has to be terminated retroactively. .

In the event of a sudden termination of the electricity supplier's operations,
all of the party's operations may not be terminated in connection with the party's
inactivation.
In the event of contract cancellation, the terminating seller's contract may not be reinstated (this is how it currently works) ). After inactivation, Datahub must be able to deliver consumption data to the seller for a period of 6 weeks (variable parameter). Users must also be able to log in to Datahub with a user account during that 6-week period. The seller must be able to update the valid contract information (billing address information, whether it is necessary ?) even after the party (supplier) has been inactivated (inactivation occurs 1-2 days after mass termination).
Supplier has suddenly stopped the business, but all activities towards datahub
cannot be stopped at the same time when party (supplier) has been inactivated.
In case of agreement cancellation the agreement of the supplier that has
stopped the business, cannot be restored v alid (this works already now). Af ter
inactiv ation datahub must be able to deliv er consumption data to supplier 6
weeks period (parameter that can be modified). Also user must be able to log in

Processing of a terminated supplier in Datahub:
- Datahub provides consumption information to y again for a period of 6 weeks (variable parameter)
for the time the contract has been in force.
- No other messages are delivered to the seller (not even for retroactive events
from the time the seller was active).
- The contract In the event of cancellation (DH-341), the contract of the terminating seller shall not be restored.
- No new open transactions are created for the seller.
- Users can log in to Datahub with a user account for a period of 6 weeks
(parameter), during which searching/viewing of data belonging to the party
is allowed normally, but the user cannot update data.
- B2B connection is only used for delivery of measurement data (and data retrieval (measurement data and DH-130 processes) -> possibly not allowed to retrieve data via B2B but onlyn user interface).

Ensuring a functional new datahub connection
Can market participants test their telecommunication connections to Datahub's B2B interface alongside the actual peek process? Of course, we can't simulate Peek invitations,
because then the events to be covered would be removed from the queue.
Our idea would therefore be to build automatic monitoring that would test making an HTTP GET call to https://b2b.datahub.fi/ in a timed manner, e.g. every 5 min. Questionnaire y n no
it is intended to use SSL Certif icate, i.e. the only thing we check about the invitation is that the "no Certif icate" information is returned from B2B. We would like to be able to monitor
the state of the communication connection, so that we can react as quickly as possible if the connections with our internal network Erko and Datahub's B2B interface are interrupted.
Will Fingrid allow it if we start monitoring the operation of telecommunications connections by making a repeated poller, which would make 288 queries to the B2B interface per day (every 5 minutes,
24/7/365). If this style of joint testing is allowed, then we could further develop the idea later so that we would make a synchronous search for a location in Datahub for
specific to the destination (with SSL certificate). In this case, it should also be tested that the B2B interface returns "sensible" answers.

Datahub will send notifications to the NTF role, e.g. of contracts requiring correction. We manage these centrally from the same email address and XXXX electricity sales

Datahub Name and Address Structure help:

When datahub reports an address whose country is other than Finland, datahub does not validate the content of the address. In this case, the address fields can be used more freely. "
I sent the above to our system supplier, because the events don't start without a house number. We have to add zero (0) to the house number for foreign addresses.
The system provider answered:
"Fingrid's document, Stage 7 Validation Rules - Update 1.xlsx
Postal Invoicing Addresses:
Either the PO Box number or the Street Name with Building Number must be submitted.
In other words, the billing address of a foreign customer must also have a street number (0, if the address does not actually have a number) or a PL number. So there is no bug in this."

End customer feedback on 18-brand

Is the cursor too long in the contract's online invoice information?
Has it come up in any of the topics that the contract's online billing data item in the data hub might be too long? To understand this, the information must be included
With an online invoice according to the Finvoice format, in a field with a length of 35 characters. In Datahub, the target length is 50 characters. A number of challenges have now arisen from this and
the messages end up in an error in the system when the system follows that limitation according to Finvoice.

New/change to validation rule(s) for exchange points to allow
change of Exchange Point Status also to "Connected",
"Disconnected" ("Deleted" only to MOP users)
As discussed on INCUSE0000063038:
Validation rule VR.MPT.010.208 allows status changes only to status "Removed f rom use" or "Under construction" via CMS GUI. This v alidation rule is NOT a v alid rule f or
exchange points as DH-400 processes are not applicable for them and statuses of exchange points are only updated via CMS GUI.
Sev eral dif f erent status changes should be enabled f or exchange points, however changing status to "Deleted" shall be possible only to MOP users.
That is not to update status "Deleted" any more to other statuses, which has been an issue in CSUSE0007508 (ADO 6217). In addition there should be a rule which would not allow
status change from "Deleted" to any other statuses.
The new validation rule/change in existing rule shall take f ollowing point into account exchange points:
- DSO users: change of Exchange Point Status allowed to: Disconnected, Connected, Under construction, Removed f rom use
- MOP users: change of Exchange Point Status allowed to: Disconnected, Connected, Under construction, Remov ed f rom use, Deleted
- It shall not be possible to update deleted exchange point to other statuses (considers all users) - not to cause issues in CSUSE0007508 (ADO 6217)
Updating of exchange points should work a bit similarly as it does now on Production units as both of these metering point types do not have DH-400 processes.

First of all, thank you for the service to see electricity consumption on an hourly basis! It has been very useful in reducing own consumption.
A further development link would be to bring spot prices together with consumption data. This could also be used to assess how the utility is able to move its own consumption away from consumption peaks.
Now this information has to be combined with difficulty from different sources.
For example, on a monthly basis, you could compare your own price with the monthly spot average and what the actual cost per hour is.

Seller: refusing to return the contract in error,
kp: XXXX, sop: YYYYY
we have received 341-3 message 3.10.2022 9:22:17 regarding the return of the contract of sale of the property to the seller's sale. The contract originally ended on 1 October 2022 at 00:00
date. Now when I send the refusal, i.e. the termination of the contract, at the original time, an error message appears: Failed to send notification of ref usal of
contract Restore for customer XXX, contract 2.
Deviation message: Decision cannot be announced until 03-Oct-2022
If it is a question of refusal, then the decision should be successful at the original time.
I want to get kp's sale in a vacant state so that I can make a contract there for seller 2 on October 1, 2022, in accordance with the business transfer ->
Supplier: Ref using of agreement restoring Returns error accounting point XXX
agreement YYY.
We have received 341-3 messages on 3.10. concerning sales agreement Restore to
supplier's sales is an accounting point. Agreement has originally ended on 1.10. If
I now sent ref using so agreement ending to the original time, it would give an error
notification to the message: Failed to send notification of ref usal of contract
Restore for customer XXXX, contract 2.
Deviation message: Ending cannot be notified before 3.10. If there is ref usal, it
should be possible to end the agreement at the original time.
I want to get the accounting point on "no supplier" state to be able to do on
accounting point, according to business transfer f rom supplier to another,
agreement for supplier 2 starting 1.10.
Challenges of refusing to reinstate the contract (DH-343-1). Example:
The sales contract has now ended as announced by the new seller
for moving in/selling 1.10. day.
3.10. on the day the new seller cancels the move-in/sale change
information about the cancellation goes to the previous seller. In addition to the cancellation information, leaves
transaction DH-343, where the returned contract is issued again
the possibility of returning the contract is denied. From return v oi
refuse work only for the current day or a maximum of 90 days into the future, i.e. here
case no earlier than 3.10. day, and not the original ending date
1.10.
Solution: In the DH-343 transaction, the seller must be able to declare
ending also on the original ending date.
DH-343-1 / Ref use restored sales agreement request problem
Example: A sales agreement has ended to a move in / seller change by a new one
DDQ Thu 1.10.
It's 3.10. the new DDQ cancels the agreement and the previous agreement
restores. The prev ious DDQ has a chance to ref use the restoring v ia DH-343-1
(=set an end date to their agreement), but it's only possible to the current date
(3.10.) or 90 days to the future.
Resolution: It should be possible for the DDQ to ref use the agreements restoring
to the original end date (in this case to 1.10.).

Further development for operator cancellation. Apparently in the beginning
the operator cancellation (AR06) tool was intended to be used
v only for canceling migrated contracts. It's working now
it has become clear that the operator's cancellation is also needed
to agreements announced by normal processes. If the contract
has already expired (e.g. announced by another seller
for moving in, or so that the market participant is himself
concluded the contract) the party can no longer cancel by itself
contract and contract cancellation are requested
from the operator. Currently, the cancellation of the operator does not send
to the parties information / or events about the completed cancellation,
and the previous seller's agreement will never be reinstated
automatically take effect. So far announcements about these
of cancellations + validity of previous agreements
returns are done manually by e-mail.
We hope that the operator's cancellation will be developed so that the seller's agreement prior to the operator's cancellation is automatically restored to the effect of the canceled agreement
for the period of validity OR the contract will return to force without an expiry date if there is no new contract at the place of use
AND that this cancellation sends transactions both to the seller and to the network.
If the previous sales contract has been concluded separately with a DH-33X transaction, with a bulk process, or an end date has been announced for the previous contract's DH-311 transaction, not valid.
the contract will automatically come back into force.
Development for market operator cancellation (AR06)
In the beginning the market operator cancellation was supposed to be used for
agreements that came through data migration. In reality, we use the market
operator cancellation is on a daily basis to cancel agreements that have been
reported v ia DH-311-process.
If the agreement has ended (either after a new agreement by another market
party OR af ter a DH-331 was reported) the market party can't cancel the
agreement any more because it has an end date. In these situations the market
parties ask us operators to cancel the agreement via market operator
cancellation.
In it's current use, the market operationr cancellation does not send any events
to market parties about the cancellation and the previous sales agreement
nev er restores automatically. In these situations the operator needs to send an
email to all the related parties in order to inform about the cancellation and in
order to inform the previous DDQ to send a new agreement to the cancellation
date
--> RESOLUTION:
We hope that the market operator cancellation will be developed in a way that:
when canceling, the previous agreement restores automatically either f or the
duration of the canceled agreement OR without the end date if there is no new one
agreement on the ACP.
AND the AR06 cancellation also sends cancellation events with restoring
information to DDQ and DSO.
Also the balance agreement should behave like in any other cancellations.

Currently, on its own, the operator cannot see the customer's information terminated-
outside the validity period of the temporary contract, in these
cases, the number of review dates must always be moved separately
for the duration of the contract, if you want to know how
customer information differs between different contracts.
We wish that datahub would also show the terminated state
regarding the contract, the customer's information without
the number of review days you need to move the contract
v for the period of validity.
The market operator can't see customer's information on the agreement's page
when the agreements status is 'Terminated' and the view date is outside the
validity period of the agreement. In order to see the customer information we
alway s need to change the view date to a certain date (when the agreement was
has status 'Conf irmed') in the past.
Resolution: We hope that the customer information could be visible to the market
Operators on any view date even though the agreement is on status
'Terminated'.

Moving out and selling to another seller?
Hello. Our information exchange has noticed inbound/outbound migrations that have raised suspicions of incorrect operation. The customer terminates the fixed term of the current seller
sale contract for moving out even after a week. The events are going on, the current seller's sales contract ends and the network has a network service contract. The place of use is
so no contract. After this, the same customer signs an electricity contract for the same place of use as a move-in with a new seller.
How does Datahub work in this situation? Does the system check whether the same customer's contract at the same place of use has expired at the same time as the new one starts? Or
will this go through as well as our exchange of information has experienced this. During the Prodat period, the networks could inform the new seller that it was not a move. Now t
Datahub had to carry out supervision on behalf of Erko. For example, customer XXXX, contract YYYY. The exchange of information was to ask the ZZZ network how to move the same customer to the same one
could have gone through to the workplace (the information exchange no longer remembered where the incident had come to light).  The network's response: "It seems that XXXX has made a contract with another seller
with on 1 October 2022 and it has been approved as a move-in, because you had previously received a notice to move out. So this is okay."
It is hardly intended that our customer service needs to ask for some proof of moving out in the future before the contract can be terminated? Considering the current electricity price level
customers will certainly be happy to receive information about the loophole that will allow them to escape from a fixed-term contract that is expensive in the future compared to the price level at the time
cleverly get rid of.

The development of ET's development team is related to customer data
Hello,
We visited on 27.9. At the meeting of the energy industry, the group work of the Säti days throughout June, and this year's days, the issues related to the datahub's customer data were discussed in particular
challenges. ET's development team also raised this as a very important issue to correct. In the discussion of the development group, it was pointed out that the management of customer information does not
corrected with the current operating model without the more active role of the data hub. The problem was seen as very big and is a sign for the entire industry, when already t invoices have gone unreasonably
collection. Due to the problems detected, some of the sellers have decided not to process customer data update requests from the data hub at all, because the vast majority of requests
or correctable information is incorrect. This was also publicly announced by Fortum on 13 September 2022 on the Datahub Service portal.
It was seen that datahub should actively and more proactively intervene in incorrect updates, not just monitor. Data validations similar to the Titta service were dug into Datahub.
It was seen that the whole process should be developed in merthoroughly and add validations. It was felt that the planned process does not work by itself. However, it was also made known that part of the reason
there are also system errors or user errors. The idea of ​​a common and single customer mailing address for all parties is not correct in all cases. Big
v a national customer may need to have different contact persons and postal addresses in different cities. The whole process should be thought from the beginning based on the observed experiences
for new ones. The issue should be raised to the top of the development list with a high priority in the datahub development team. It was proposed that a separate subsidiary group be established under the datahub's development group
to think about correction proposals and a new process for managing customer information. With this developing ticket, we want to start promoting this issue.
Best regards my friend,
