A current overview of the data hub and review of the previous minutes 
Jenni Mäkinen went through the customer service information in appendix 1 "Datahub Customer Service". 
affiliations - development work group 03-2023" according to The ticket situation has been really good 
and especially the contacts from end customers have decreased considerably compared to the previous
compared to its passage. 
There have been a number of contacts from the networks stating that the sales companies
increasingly, the end customer goes to the online companies' customer services to find out 
different situations. In such situations, the situation would in many cases be resolved in such a way that 
these would be checked on the seller's side directly from the datahub user interface. Jenni mentioned 
also that it is possible to request a data hub to practice using the user interface 
from customer service to train people to use the user interface (for example,
on site, to Fingrid Datahub's office or through Teams).

Pia Aaltonen commented that inquiries about location IDs are one thing that is completely 
comprehensible, where the customer is directed to connect to the network. Especially if you use
there are several jobs at the same address, the seller cannot know which of these would be needed
whatever it is. However, the networks always have accurate information about the situation. 
Pia commented that the opportunities for additional training on the user interface could very well be
also with a newsletter. Jenni said that this additional training was started during the spring 
for a couple of parties, and in addition to this, the development group is one forum where inquiries are made 
the first interest for trainings. 
Next, the minutes of the previous meeting were reviewed under Marko's leadership.  
Marko asked if the quick instructions for cancellations presented in the previous meeting had been received 
use?  
Greetta Arha commented that in relation to the matter, ET's working groups have discussed who should come 
make different use cases in the instructions and compile examples of these. This was discussed 
and it was generally stated that instructions and concrete examples from datahub were desired for this. 
However, Datahub has visibility into all different cases and thus a good basis for
give examples. Wading through instructions from different parties side by side is often tedious 
and unclear. Thus, it would be clearer that the instructions, for example, in these cases of cancellations
in the pauses should come comprehensively from datahub with example cases. 
Pia added that the instructions would need concrete practical examples. You could do these 
add to the end of the instruction. The instructions themselves are clear, but examples would be a good addition. 
Pia comments on the necessary and possible changes to customer data update events 
new inspection rules. Are a few individual increases in checks sufficient, which
they would still allow certain deviations and updates against the rules, such as stairs 
lowercase letters. However, do these support the issue as a whole? Some companies are

Marko further clarified when Greetta was moving to Väre? Greetta confirmed that

#33: Jenni presented the development proposal and its solution description. In Appendix 3 "Development
proposal-33 - review" is also presented different processes and events, which
hit proposal and its presented solution would have an impact and open questions
not regarding the proposed solution of the development proposal. 
o Pia commented that how in the sellers' own systems can out-
moving out, if the destination has already been moved out for the same day. Day-
it is of course possible to advance the amount, but at least they have
it is not possible to make a declaration for the same day for which moving out has already been declared. 
In this context, are we talking about large numbers of events at all? 
Is it more difficult to catch such cases nowadays when da-
tahub makes a deduction, when would the new contract come back into force? 
o Kirsi Jylhä commented that they have at least a couple of networks with the system 
these cases come up and remain in open events. Pia commented 
here, whether they can move out in these situations in the system 
for the same day, which object has already been notified to move out? Kirsi comments
said he couldn't. Pia completed whether it makes sense to add a function to the data hub, already
hon parties' systems still don't bend? Kirsi added that if the
are small, the change can be made via the user interface, if your system
this is not the case. 
o Päivi Karppanen commented that they have had the events in question and pre-
the solution made is good in itself, but with this discussion it makes me wonder, 
how would these cases be handled in practice? Requires verification-
system changes for them too, because today it would not tend to present
to the action. 
o Mia Nyman commented that this was presented in their system as well 
the solution would also require changes. 
o Pia commented that it would be good to discuss the matter with the system suppliers 
with. How many systems is the implementation of this solution for in general 
require changes? 
o Kirsi commented that the issue should also be looked at in the long term. Although the thing 
would require changes, however, the issue will occur in the future and that's it 
good to get a solution. 
The view of the members of the working group on the promotion of the proposal: 
o Pia: the idea is good, but requires going through with the system suppliers 
o Päivi: the idea is good, but required changes in the parties' systems 
must be clarified. The matter should be referred to the sub-working group. 
o Pekka Eerikäinen: It sounds like the costs will be more 
from the system development side of the parties. The needs of the parties must be clarified
for system changes through a sub-working group.

o Mia: The proposal should be circulated through the sub-working group. If it can be done 
through the user interface and only applies to individual cases, would this be the case 
however easier to do there? This option should also be considered. 
o Kirsi: I agree that the matter should be recycled through the sub-working group. Also 
the possibility of the user interface must be verified in this context. 
o Niina Leikas: The matter should be promoted and the described situations should function as data-
in the hub. The matter should be referred to the sub-working group. 
o Greetta: agree with others, very good comments, thing 
to be dealt with in the sub-working group as well. 
o Jari Arve: I agree, the matter should be recycled in a sub-working group. Also the user interfaces
possibility should be investigated in this context. 
o Kari Iltola: agree, the matter should be referred to a sub-working group for consideration. 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion:  
Let's take the proposal to the sub-working group for consideration. We also examine the presented ti-
number of hips and the possibility to make a situation in thesemissing the necessary ones 
changes with the user interface.

#50+#238: Laura Markkanen presented the development proposal and its solution description. 
Appendix 4 "Development proposal #50_ja_#238" details the decision of the development proposal
cuddling imaging and processes related to this. 
o Pia asked why a new message would be needed in this context? Laura full-
densi that this would require a message with less information than the
in the current DH-122-2 message and the need for a new message therefore arises 
from here. 
o Pia commented on whether it would not be possible to use the currently used sa-
noma, which is used in the declaration of the place of use (DH-131). 
This contains the same necessary information that is needed in this context. 
Laura commented that this event lacks information about the entry into force, 
which is needed again in this context. The new seller therefore needs information 
from the date of entry into force, i.e. from when the change in question becomes applicable
calla enters into force. 
o Päivi comments that there is a problem if entry into force is considered to be
from the date of arrival? Laura commented that the problem would be the future
in the case of the updates coming into effect, that the transmission of messages
would then make an appointment with a new seller. Retroactive updates would also prevent 
this, because the information would have been valid earlier than at what moment the message was given 
has come 
o Pia comments that it certainly depends on the sellers, how many such contracts
there are items. In general, the addition of a new message must always be explained in detail
min and the possibilities for utilizing existing messages is 
reason to map.

o Päivi commented that this too should definitely be taken to the sub-working group to
lead. 
The view of the members of the working group on the promotion of the proposal: 
o Jari: The matter was discussed with our system supplier and we thought, 
why the time step update event DH-125 is not included in the event
where? Laura comments that the time step is not the kind of information that comes
the power seller has the right. Jari added that in general it would be good if hubi bundles
probably changes that will come into force in the future 
at the place of use and the sellers would receive compiled information about them. This would require var-
required a separate walkthrough as its own entity. Otherwise, the proposal is good 
can continue. 
o Greetta: Information to be received by the new seller about the change in the status of the place of use. If 
possible, you could use the return message of the usage location information here. 
The addition of a new message is always a big change and should rather be utilized 
existing messages. The matter should be referred to a sub-working group for consideration. 
o Kari: The same comments as Greeta, to be taken to the sub-working group for processing. 
o Niina: The new seller must receive information about changes in the place of use. You ponder-
method, whether the query of usage location information can be used here. The seller's
the system could make an automatic request for location information according to
upon entry into force. This returns the location of the most recent data
arum. In any case, the matter should be referred to a sub-working group for consideration. 
o Kirsi: It is supported and the matter must also be taken to the sub-working group. 
o Mia: The information to be obtained by the new seller and the matter should be handled by the system
with gauges. There may also be changes that will only come into force 
after the entry into force of the new contract, this information would not be restored en-
in the survey conducted on the same contract day. These must be obtained 
also the information for the new seller and that should be taken into account in the solution. 
o Pekka: Would it be possible to open the legal side of this, when the new seller still has 
already have a contract with the customer? Isn't it the same information that is being passed on 
for the current seller, could you also forward it to the new seller? Why not here 
could open the contractual side and thus avoid a challenging solution? Pia com-
mentioned that this is a matter arising from the GDPR and that is why the new seller is not 
entitled to all information at the place of use before the start of the new contract. 
Pekka added that in these cases the information is completely technical, why 
these could not be passed on to a new seller. Now we are building challenging solutions
suja, even if with the opening of the legal side the matter would be feasible considerably
just more simply in systems. 
o Pia and Päivi had nothing to add to the previous comments on the matter. Thing 
should be taken to the system suppliers for processing. 
o Pekka also commented that the technical data, such as the update of the time step, does not 
is not personal information and thus the possibilities of the legal side should be examined.

Here, the more challenging solution presented now could be avoided considerably 
simpler, if the matter can be made easier from the legal side 
here. 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion:  
The matter will be referred to the sub-working group. The GDPR issue is unlikely to be changed, 
but this will also be checked, if the legal side eases the matter 
solvable more simply.

#194: Jenni presented the development proposal and its solution description. 
The view of the members of the working group on the promotion of the proposal: 
o Pia: we support the proposal, we do a lot of this repair as well 
o Päivi: supported 
o Pekka: yes, a sensible change 
o Mia: supported 
o Kirsi: supported 
o Niina: supported 
o Greetta: a common mistake and annoying to make the online company always a ticket of these, 
we definitely support the change 
o Kari: yes, we support it 
o Jari: we have not recognized this issue, and the situations in question have not arisen 
out. So there is no need, but if it is necessary for others, it can be taken 
ahead. 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: 
The development proposal is supported and it will be taken forward. 
• 
#177: Minna Luojus presented the development proposal and its solution description. 
o Greetta comments that she doesn't know the seller's side that well in this context, 
so what is the situation now for the seller? Minna said that the seller gets this 
currently with messages (DH-611) information on all individual balance sheet errors and 
the total amounts from each network area in which the seller's accumulated balance
them. With the user interface, sellers can view the results online
i.e. at the moment there is no single view from which the seller can see the entire
from the area of ​​all networks in the mouth. 
o Pia added that at least they have implemented in their own system a
female report on the information contained in the messages. This has been deemed necessary 
and this has clearly been missing from the hub since the beginning.

o Kirsi commented that this is the issue that was taken care of before the data hub 
with excels between networks and sellers? Minna answered, yes, balance error pro-
the session was previously done with Excel and the current DH-600 messages are ear-
these. 
o Marko pointed out that the whole industry should also be evaluated in particular 
point of view, because not all sellers necessarily have types of total ra-
gates themselves. 
The view of the members of the working group on the promotion of the proposal: 
o Pia: I don't have an acute need for a report, but the situation in terms of the entire industry 
may be different for the companies, we support the proposal. 
o Päivi: This could be promoted and a good solution in the long term. Ra-
the gate could have been there from the beginning. How many sellers currently co-
who needs this? 
o Pekka: In terms of equality, it is good that also for sellers (and not only 
for networks) information on the overall situation is available. 
o Jari: I didn't recognize the need for this myself, but if there is a need for others, then
tus can be continued, no objection to this. 
o Greetta: the matter goes to the "nice to have" department and we could do without it. Ta-
However, error calculation is an important process and can be large 
of sums. The size range of the proposal is a bit confusing, but it's worth putting 
to continue. 
o Kari: Doesn't apply to own operations, but based on what I've heard, it seems useful
from that and necessary for others, to be continued. 
o Niina: Certainly useful, continue. 
o Kirsi: We support equality 
o Mia: I don't see the need myself, but continue if it is necessary for others. 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: 
The development proposal is supported and it will be taken forward. 
Next, we went through development proposals that required more discussion and lin-
from the development team. In the attachments "Datahub change requests 20230306" and primer 
for discussion and questions:  
• 
#16: Pia presented the development proposal and Laura the solution description.  
o Marko commented that the size of the development proposal remains 1 and 2
to the limit of kan, i.e. the amount would be slightly more than €10,000.

o Mia: This change would be good to have and our system supplier 
opinion was suggested solution 1. Yes, it would also be necessary to send to the network 
information about the contract that remains in force. 
o Kirsi: Not recognized for thisu need, but if others need it, then ok 
carry forward. Option 1 is clearer.

o Greetta: Knowledge and understanding of the data hub has certainly grown already

I always turn to everyone. What measures does the matter cause if it is made retroactive 
cancellation? Pia commented that it is better to be able to see the end date-
amount, so that you don't have to calculate yourself how long the contract is valid.  
At least the extension is a good thing, so that information about it goes to the network as well, 
option 1 is better in this context. 
o Jari: There have been few cases, option 1 was seen as a better solution. 
o Kari: It doesn't concern us, but based on what we heard, option 1 is here 
better. 
o Pekka: Doesn't apply to the 3rd party, I can't take a position on options 1 and 2
lilla, sounds like a necessary change in general. 
o Päivi: Necessary proposal for sellers and networks, and option 1 is better.

Summary of the proposal and its promotion 
The development proposal received support and it will be taken forward with the presented solution-
in accordance with option 1, also taking into account the network.

#126: Minna presented the development proposal and its solution description.  
o Pia commented at the beginning that the current reasoning about netting is not
in accordance with lytapa, if the places of use are in the names of different customers. 
o Kirsi asked why the objects behind the same meter must be allowed to be 
in the name of different customers?  
o Greetta commented that the matter in question comes from measurement legislation, because
I created it, it is not simple to change. 
The view of the members of the working group on the promotion of the proposal: 
o Pia: We have had a case where it was necessary to request a decision
country in such a situation. How many of these cases where the customer 
would ask for netting to be decided, is there at all? The amounts are hardly large, 
so there would be no need to make a new message for the announcement of the matter, but 
in these cases we are connected to the network.

o Päivi: As a rule, we currently do not have separate production sites 
meters. Avoiding netting in these situations would therefore require separate 
installing meters. 
o Kirsi: Installation of the meter in these situations could be for a fee, in which case
the usual change would not necessarily be profitable for the customer.

view of what the need for such cases really is. A couple of incidents 
that's why it's not worth going to do it. 
o Jari: Only one such case has come to light, if the amounts are so small
yes, the current operating model is sufficient. 
o Greetta: The need is very little, there are always challenging customers, in these 
a case-by-case assessment is always needed. However, there is no need to da-
for tahub's development in this situation. 
o Kari: Based on what I heard, more of an exceptional case, there is no need to
this.

After the meeting, the clarified answer by mediating the corrections of measurement data
regarding the authorizations that have ended for the 3rd parties: 
The measurement data is forwarded to the 3rd party only if the authorizations are valid. 
If the measurement data from the authorization period is corrected, the authorization ends 
after, this is no longer forwarded to a 3rd party. 
To ensure the schedule, item 6 of the agenda was dealt with exceptionally next. 
Processing and discussions on the matter presented in accordance with the agenda under point 6. After this

Status reviews regarding the progress of development proposals 
• 
The general situation of the development proposals and the development proposals previously recommended in the development working group
the situation of the dots:  
Marko first presented the general situation of development proposals in Appendix 6 "Datahub Development Proposal
progress according to 032023”. 
Päivi comments on whether, chronologically, development proposals have been processed in such a way that previously
have the proposals been brought up for consideration first? Marko commented that this is generally the case 
yes, of course, higher-priority presentations have been brought forward for consideration earlier as necessary. 
Marko looked through the list of development proposals from the beginning and concluded that most of the parents were
lut processing. Päivi commented that this is good and the old burden should be obtained first
tented and promoted before newer proposals. 
Pia commented on whether, with regard to older development proposals, the presenters had been asked whether there was a problem
are you still valid? Marko answered that he has always been asked as needed. If problems 
have still been valid, they have been carried forward as development proposals. 
Next, the development proposals previously recommended by the development work group were reviewed
lumbar. Marko commented that the transition from project activities to operational development
the model has taken time and this can also be seen in the forwarding of development proposals. Data-
hub's system supplier development model has been reorganized and will be focused in the future 
CGI for the Finnish team. So there is still some way back here. 
Pia asked how many resources CGI has reserved for the further export of development proposals? 
Marko comments that new resources and former project
tial organizations have been run down when the transition to operational activities has taken place. This change is 
clearly seen in the ability to make progress.

Pekka commented that there are three limitations to the promotion of proposals: how much time the group has time 
process proposals, how many proposals can be taken forward with CGI and how much 
there is a budget for these. Are these constraints in balance or is one of these back bul-
lonneck? 
Marko commented that there are currently around 30 proposals in the work queue and there is a bottleneck 
clearly at the current pace of CGI development. The working group has time to promote proposals more
in terms of m and minor development, we still stay well within the budget. 
Pia asked if there will be two system updates per year in the future as well? 
Marko commented that this comes from the pace of updating the main versions of CGI's product and the daily
are tied to it, although many development changes do not require a new version 
of the product. Even in terms of testing, however, it is more efficient to act this way. Individual ki-
however, real supplementary versions are made for development sites. 
Pia stated that if you have had a bad conscience about the fact that you could not progress here
ty suggestions, then there seems to be no concern if the bottleneck is in making CGI. go-
in development, let's have a discussion between datahub and CGI about it, if not for some version 
have time to e.g. do some major update, but could fit a smaller ke-
a hit? Marko commented that this kind of discussion takes place practically every week. 
Pia raised that the items under construction status and netting & under construction status should be resolved 
soon. These constantly come up and cause costs for the parties, e.g. in order to 
the necessary measures can be taken manually through the system supplier in order to 
the customer can be invoiced for netting items. 
Pia also comments that there are two times in practice where updates are not expected 
and they are Midsummer and Christmas. These moments should be calmed down, because resourcing and
the correction of minor problem situations is always more challenging in them. Marko commented, 
that the aim is to calm down these moments in the future, and that they will not, in principle, be scheduled
theta updates. The updates would be timed well before Christmas or at the beginning of the year.   
 
• 
Content of future versions 2.0.x and 2.1:  
Next, Marko presented the contents of the future versions 2.0.x and 2.1 in appendix 7 "Datahub future
vat versions according to 032023”. 
Jari commented regarding the supplemental version 2.0.x that the system supplier needs a quick
realistically more detailed documents so that the necessary changes can be implemented 
on time. Marko comments that we will come back to this later in the presentation. 
Pia commented that the correction regarding proposal #202 is important. Here, the parties do not 
will get an invoiced customer and this also affects electricity credits, which will not be successful if 
invoicing is not successful. Marko commented that this fix is ​​prioritized for the 2.0.x supplemental
version and its importance has been emphasized.

Pia commented that the Datahub Palvelut portal had apparently already been updated in some respects. 
Are there any further updates to this or were all the changes already brought in? Marko com-
mentioned that not all have been brought in, there are even more changes and updates coming here
that. 
Pia commented that on the Services page, in the development team's documentation, it disturbs 
that the latest version of the working group minutes always goes to the last of the list, which is good 
illogical. Also in the Documentation section, it bothers me that the lists are very long 
and contains different versions and documentation in different languages. It would be good to update the listings here
and filters by e.g. language or version.

The industry's comments on the recommendations of meetings 2 and 3 of the development working group
for hit suggestions 
Laura presented a summary of the industry's comments at meetings 2 and 3 of the development group 
to the recommended development proposals in Appendix 8 "Datahub recommended development proposals
in accordance with 
According to the comment to proposal #54, the reasons for the change were not quite 
clear and missed the feature related to the AR04 cancellation reason to leave a return
without the previous agreement coming into force. 
Pia asked what effect the industry comments have on the decided development proposals. In
shall I still modify the development proposals based on them or abandon the already advanced
of the proposals decided upon? 
Marko stated that there is no intention to cancel the decision regarding the comments regarding the development proposal 
basis, but if necessary, it will be processed again or the justifications will be supplemented. 
Greetta commented that AR04 was a useless functionality, at least for the network. It is more clear-
head, that the online and sales contract is canceled on the same day in these situations. AR04 
with that, the online contract remained in effect again. 
Pia commented that AR04 was introduced as an alternative in those situations where the contract is canceled
guarantee, but the customer's move-in does not. These situations had to be solved before the datahub ver-
between the company and the seller.Kirsi comments that in these situations, the difficulty is caused by the fact that the online contract remains 
valid for a few days without a sales contract. The problem arises from the fact that 
sales and online contracts remain in force on different dates. This causes manual
list work for networks, when the network contract has to be updated manually in these situations. 
Niina comments that this reason for cancellation will not be missed. This has caused a lot of problems
mia and manual correction. 
Laura commented that in that comment the reason for the AR04 cancellation was in favor 
it was seen that it did not reinstate the previous sales and network agreement. Is it 
is this feature much needed, and otherwise taken into account at a sufficient level?

Suvi comments that this feature is not needed. The comment has also come before 
a new quick instruction for cancellations has been brought to the parties and this could have been unclear in other ways
how to do cancellations, and the quick guide has certainly brought clarity to this, e.g. you use-
for possible cancellation reasons from different situations.

Options for promoting the availability requirement of Datahub's service contract
dot, chat 
Marko presented appendix 5 "Datahub's service contract - availability deviation concept-
lyn – development group 20230321" in accordance with the background to the datahub service contract-
to promote its availability requirements. There were no comments in the background and Marko presented
chose option 1 presented first. 
Pia asked if there has ever been a situation where the datahub starts squatting on someone or something
because of the actions of individual actors? Elina Konttinen comments that yes it is 
there have been observations that the transaction volumes of a certain party have increased exceptionally
sesti and this may have been visible to others in action. The person in question has always been contacted about these 
party and asked to remedy the situation. 
Pia asked, have these been the actual reasons for some disturbances, for example? Elina needs
felt that it is difficult to say whether these are the ones that caused the disturbances. In these situations 
there have often been some other events or deviations that have a simultaneous effect 
could cause a disturbance. 
Marko also asked if these had clearly been actions contrary to the instructions? Elina needs
I also found that yes, for example, this has been observed in Peekkaus events. 
Marko introduced option 2, which is presented next. 
Jari commented that they would lean towards option 2. With this option, we can
as a tool for interfering with faulty operation. Exclusion should have a clear cri-
a set of principles according to which these actions could be taken. In addition, the party in question would 
first contact and ask for corrective measures before the actual exclusion. If from here 
create a set of criteria, it would certainly not be unambiguous and maintenance would certainly be tedious.  
Marko commented that yes, this option would be further specified (if this
which situations would lead to exclusion and always first contact the
part of the wrong action and is asked to rectify the situation before the actual exclusion
chemist.  
Jari added that the long-term exclusion of a party can even cause 
more harm to other parties than the original action against the instructions. 
Pekka commented that when comparing these options, option 1 could also be used 
to have to exclude a party if system maintenance requires it. In option 2 
this possibility would also be legally in the tool selection and clearly presented as one 
as an action for incorrect actions of the parties. Exclusion would always be comprehensive
nen's consideration and it can be difficult to create a complete list of situations in which this
here. There is no risk of this tool being used inappropriately, 
however, this is an extreme measure.

Suvi Manninen came to the scene around 12:35 and commented on the options presented, that especially 
in option 2, clarifications would be needed as to what this would mean. It's hard to give now 
carries neither, when the effect of the solutions has not been described at a more detailed level. 
Pia commented that the effects on other parties should also be specified in the alternatives. 
How does the exclusion of one party affect the others, do they have to completely stop
guarantee the attribution of certain events to an excluded party?  
Soon nosti also point out that the datahub has its own SLAs and the reports show e.g. a disruption 
start at 9:00 a.m., although the effect on the parties may have already started earlier in the morning (before the
the start of the velua period, these were discussed in the previous meeting). 
Päivi commented that option 2 should also specify the excluded party's pa-
ferry back, in which time the party should, for example, process the accumulated events
mats?  
Kirsi commented that in this situation could there be, for example, exceptional time limits and so-
within the framework of the accumulated events? 
Greetta comments that option 2 is good in itself, when there is a clear sanction, what the instructions
caused by activities against it. However, should we also include col-
as an alternative, the commercial sanction model, i.e. the disruptive party would have to pay
the country's activities? 
Suvi commented that it is a good solution that exclusion would be an option if a party 
would work wrong. It should be specified here that what the exclusion of everything causes
maybe? Would it only concern the disconnection of the B2B interface and the party could still use the user interfaces
what? In this way, the exclusion of one party would not cause chaos in the market
for that. This would be a relaxation of full exclusion and the excluded party should re-
to curtail its operations so that the operation can be managed through the user interface. 
Marko comments that this is a good comment and that this should be taken into account when solving
you will be defined in more detail (if we end up with option 2). Different on such a precise level 
alternatives have not yet been discussed and defined. 
Greetta comments that using only the user interface is really challenging with large data
amounts and it would eventually become visible to other parties as well.  
Pekka commented that here the inconvenience and the price should be lower than that the whole system
the statement would fail due to incorrect operation. If enabling the use of the user interface affects
tus to other market participants can be mitigated, so it should be in the selection.  
The working group's comments and view of the presented alternatives: 
o Pia: Option 2, but this should be specified. 
o Päivi: Option 2, but needs clarification. 
o Pekka: I agree with the previous ones.

o Summer: Option 2, but a bit conditional as this has yet to be truly presented 
on a narrow level. 
o Jari: Option 2 is supported in more detail, e.g. criteria and impact 
other parties should be specified. 
o Kari: We support option 2. 
o Greetta: Decisive actions are required for the wrong action, we support an alternative 
2. This still needs clarifications, what will affect it in practice.

I will still go to the customer committee for consideration and then to EV.
