Development proposal #57 – Changes to the status information of the site under construction 
Laura Markkanen presented the development proposal (Appendix 1) and the group members were asked 
comments on the proposal as well as possible additions, what other spaces might be needed 
observe. 
Pia Aaltonen: From the seller's point of view, it is a difficult situation if the dates in the contracts change. 
Additions of status information also give the seller additional information and a better picture of the object 
of the real situation. 
Greetta Arha: I can't think of any other spaces that would fit here, in addition to the spaces shown 
observe. Renovation and Liittymä uppåppidolla statuses describe the places of use well 
situation, the "Under Construction" mode alone does not cover everything necessary. 
Jari Arve: The additional facilities will clarify the situation and the change is supported. 
Kari Iltola: Based on what we have heard, the change sounds clear and necessary. 
Päivi Karppanen: A change is needed, I can't think of any other facilities that should be added. 
Kirsi Jylhä: The addition of premises clarifies the operation and is a necessary change to the process. 
Suvi Manninen: No addition, change is necessary. 
Niina Leikas: A necessary change so that the start dates of the contracts do not change. 
As a representative of the selling company, I consider that the change is beneficial, but the distribution network company 
as a representative, I am worried about whether this will require a lot of changes to the work regulations as well 
and background systems. 
Pekka Eerikäinen: A clear need for change. 
Samuli Saine: The effect of new facilities on reminders of measurement data should also be taken into account, 
this is not yet included in the material. 
Fingrid will also conduct a review of the impact of the new facilities on measurement data 
for reminders. 
Tarja Teroheimo: a position should also be taken on the delivery of measurement data, new state data 
regarding, i.e. whether measurement information is required for new facilities and what kind of reminders are sent from these. 
Jani Pasanen: The new facilities are useful. The root cause of the change is the contracts 
change of start dates, whether the possibility of changing the logic has been investigated 
regarding contract date changes? In other words, new premises would not be added 
the logic by which the start date of the contract is changed for Rakenteilla employees would be changed 
in terms of places of use. 
Pia: As an alternative to the fact that moving the space from Structured to Connected would not change the contracts 
start date would have been that the seller cancels the old contract completely and creates 
in accordance with the connection date of the new contract. This would be especially the case with large ones 
caused a huge amount of manual work for sales companies.

Päivi: The withdrawal soon is essential and this change in the start date of the contracts was necessarypresent, 
because otherwise it would have meant the cancellation of contracts and re-announcements. 
Tarja: The addition of new facilities at the place of use is a big change in the system and affects several 
in processes. The need for the under renovation space is clear. It is important to always look at 
how easily new spaces are created and whether more of these will be created in the future as soon as 
does the need arise? The addition of new status information is not always clear-cut and adds complexity. 
Sari Savikoski: Many things affect the whole and it is a degree more complex to export 
forward change with regard to new state information. The creation of new spaces should always be considered 
effect and examine whether it is possible to make new changes, e.g. on the Datahub side 
instead of premises. 
Suvi: Is it easier to implement additions to the contract status information in the changes? Could you 
for example, tackled with these and by examining the contract processing logic of the Under Construction mode 
an increase in the premises of the place of use? 
Greetta: Basically, it's best to always go forward with a solution that 
causes the smallest change and does not require major measures. Effect of changes 
to be looked at as a whole, without making the heaviest changes of all. We will take note 
also the costs on Datahub's side and for each system supplier. 
Laura continued to review the development proposal and the impact of the new facilities on the contracts 
to the conclusion and the start of delivery. There were no comments on the presented effects. 
No position was taken yet on the process of measurement data reminders DH-212, but this 
the effect of new status information on these will be reviewed and added. 
Laura recounted the impact of the new state information on processes DH-121 and DH-122.  
Jani: Under construction status should be removed for allowed status updates, if under construction status 
reserved only for new properties. It should not be possible to reach the target again 
Under construction mode. The possibility of moving the place of use back to Under Construction mode would break it 
this logic regarding the use of new premises and would thus also affect the contracts 
to start. 
Niina: It should be clear how changes can be made to the different facilities when the new ones 
status information is included. 
Jari: It would be good to have, for example, a table to which space something can be moved. That would clear it up 
activities for different premises. 
Laura continued to review the development proposal and the mandatory information required for the new premises 
regarding. 
Jani: The meter may, in some situations be removed with Renovation items, in others maybe not. 
This should be taken into account for mandatory information. 
In principle, the same requirements are required for new Renovation and Connection maintenance facilities 
mandatory information, which also in the Under construction mode. You can submit comments and 
pay more attention later.

Laura continued the impact of the new facilities on the processes for DH-13X and DH-412. Members don't 
other processes emerged that should be taken into account. Previously mentioned measurement data 
the process of reminders DH-212 will still be reviewed in terms of new premises. 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: 
• 
Let's move this proposed solution forward. We'll look into it some more 
a proposal where a change would be made to the logic by which Datahub changes with Structures -
the beginning of the contracts for temporary use. The possibility of this option and 
the requirements are clarified. Let's find out the options and the scope of these changes 
between the two presented solutions. 
• 
We are trying to bring the change either in datahub 2.1 version in spring 2023 or then in 2.2 
in the version in the fall of 2023. But we can only get to a more detailed schedule planning 
when the solution method and its details become clear.

Development proposal #X – Production equipment power data 
Laura presented the development proposal (Appendix 1) and its proposed solutions. 
Pia: If the place of use is under construction (or renovation, maintenance), is it even? 
is it possible that such objects could be notified of the power data of the production device? Is it 
this kind of thing known to these? 
Niina: At Kerava, with regard to new production equipment, everything presented will be announced immediately 
information. 
Samuli: The same lift as Pia, is it even available for the Rakenteilla site? 
this information. Is it challenging for Datahub to implement validation independently? 
from the state of the place of use? 
Laura commented that when reporting first only the production site without device and power data, 
there remains the possibility of not adding the required information to the place of use later. This 
would affect the netting, and later there may be challenges in reporting the information. 
Pekka: Power information should come with the production device. 
Suvi: The only case encountered where the power data of the production device has been missing isbeen 
user error. By default, a production device is not reported without power information. 
Samuli: The power should always be declared at the same time as the production device. 
Tarja: Power information should always be reported for the production device. However, it is 
possible to declare a parallel production location without a production device? When 
the production device is reported, the power data is also reported.  
Laura commented that it is possible to declare a parallel production location without 
production equipment. 
Päivi: It makes sense to report all the information at once.

Kirsi: The production device and its power data should be reported at the same time. 
Jani: In what situation could a parallel use location be declared without a production device? 
It is possible that the netting information is activated and the parallel information should be removed 
temporarily so that the production device can be added later. 
Tarja: There are possibly items that you don't want to include in the netting, in which case they would be left out 
production device unannounced. However, we want the information to be reported according to the processes, 
in which case Jani's challenge may come to the fore. 
Laura: The challenge in question exists and really requires parallelism 
temporarily so that the data of the production device can be added later. 
Samuli: Is it possible to perform validation when confirming the measurement data? Or 
it is validated that the production site, to which the information is delivered, has power information and not 
would allow delivery of measurement data to a production site that lacks power data. 
Greetta: If simpler solutions are feasible, these options should also be used 
view.  
Samuli: Partly a bit off topic, but is it possible that 
the series formed by the netting calculation would not be the information used in invoicing? This thing 
has been busy.  
Minna Luojus: Suddenly, I can't think of situations where this wouldn't be the case. This is coming 
to take a closer look and come back to the matter later. 
Summary: 
• 
Regarding the validation of power data of production equipment, the change will be carried forward 
without having to take into account the space in the construction of the place of use, i.e. the rule becomes:   
Proposal for new validation rules in DH-121/122/124 processes: 
1. Maximum power is mandatory for production equipment, 
2. The maximum power unit is mandatory for the production device. 
• 
The validation change of the power data of the production device (mandatory power data) is 
with the aim of bringing into production 11/2022, i.e. before the 2.0 update.
