Next, we divided into smaller groups, where we discussed the points raised by the participants
observations, and finally the groups shared the results of the small group discussions together
damn it. 
Summary of the discussion: 
What's good about the plan? 
• 
The following were brought up as general issues: 
- 
Widely considered use cases and needs that are not met in the current state 
- 
Authorizations through integrations are well taken into account 
- 
The blank is in the right direction, we need a proper roadmap for different needs. Mass needs 
vs. individual authorization needs are completely different challenges. 
- 
Extensive participation of various parties in the handling of the case is ok 
• 
Individual development issues were particularly considered to be good: 
- 
Authorization valid for the time being 
- 
Authorization service to be integrated 
- 
Authorization of several places of use at once 
- 
Termination of authorizations by the party 
- 
Sending an authorization request 
What is missing from the plan? What else are you waiting for? 
• 
Desirable details of the plan: 
- 
The transition to a new process must be planned: how to handle the existing ones vs. 
the coming authorizations according to the new model and what the transition period will be like. 
- 
Schedule 
- 
Clarifying the use of suomi.fi authorizations: what is the relationship between suomi.fi authorizations 
datahub's authorizations and the strong identification of the party's own service. 
- 
Use case 1: in the authorization service, authorizations and user
for location search and for the search for measurement data of existing locations, since
loin customer logs in only once. The location search can also be used
soon for the authorization of new places of use. The process could also start in part-
on behalf of, who requests authorization both for the application location search and for all existing ones 
existing authorizations. 
- 
Use case 2: the customer has the option to choose "I give the party permission to apply 
all my places of use and their measurement data"

- 
Different types of cases and variations should be opened up and clarified more, so that different
those needs come to the fore and the solution(s) can be designed to be functional and smooth 
from the customer's point of view. The basic solution must be easy, but even the most demanding
be able to support. 
• 
New thoughts: 
- 
Search for valid authorizations via the interface 
- 
Issuing authorizations without entering an address- authorization request “on the fly” 
for all usage points from which the customer selects the desired one in the authorization service 
- 
If you know the usage point or address, but not the contract maker/holder, how could you 
apply for it? 
- 
Development of authorizations for other information, MGA amounts between networks, MGA amount for the entire network, total consumption of the entire network, total production, etc. 
What concerns and questions does the plan raise? 
• 
Schedule 
• 
Customer communication, communication plan. 
• 
What if there is no response to the authorization request? Pending requests should be notified by 
email so that they do not remain internal to the service, because customers may not 
use the Datahub service often. 
• 
How can authorizations and the authorization process be made as 
easy and understandable as possible for the customer? 
- 
Without writing addresses, all usage locations/contracts based on the business ID/business ID 
- 
Granting multiple authorization types at once, kp search, measurement information, contract information 
- 
Easy approval of pending authorization requests 
- 
Smooth user/customer transition between the authorization service and the party's service 
- 
The service provider has the opportunity to initiate the process on behalf of the customer. 
• 
Authorizations for corporate customers 
- 
Who can issue and who has the legal right to issue authorizations? Who can issue an authorization from the company and who, for example, from property management agencies? 
Can authorizations be chained, => As Oy end user => Property manager => service provider? 
- 
How to enable authorizations issued by foreign business decision-makers?

- 
Does it employ or facilitate decision-makers? 
• 
Authorization validity 

- 
Can Datahub automatically notify the service provider about the expiration/approval/rejection of the authorization? 
- 
How to get a notification about an expiring/expiring authorization? 
- 
What would be the optimal authorization validity? 
- 
Get rid of the backlash from authorizations, since there is no legal basis for it. 
It is better to sanction authorization errors in the termination of authorizations than to create a massive hassle of re-authorization. 
• 
Suomi.fi authorization usage: 
- 
Does Suomi.fi get a function directly through authorization processing? 
- 
Could the suomi.fi service directly drive authorization information, integration into the DVV service? 
- 
Can a separate authorization service provide interfaces through which the service provider can reject/approve authorization on behalf of the user, e.g. based on the suomi.fi identifier that the service provider has already received from the consumer? 
• 
Authorization given to the seller in the future: could the authorization cover the entire history of the point of use (not just the latest agreement)? 
• 
Agreement information with authorization to a 3rd party: Is there a risk that someone could misuse the authorization? E.g. would the service provider offer the seller a service where the price would be affected by information about the current agreement? 
• 
More use cases are needed, at least options within them. 
• 
Hopefully, the current authorization mechanism via the portal will be maintained. Requests and authorizations via the user interface should be maintained. 
• 
The adequacy of Datahub's performance, if, for example, long-term consumption of several locations is requested. 
• 
Message changes

Summary of the day and agreement on the next steps 
As a summary, the participant was asked to tell/record how they would like the working group to work in the future. Summary of the answers: 
- 
Let's continue working on the issue and gradually go into smaller details. 
This time, a wide range of different actors were involved, which helped to understand the issue

extent. Meetings remotely and sufficiently short (max 3 hours) keep the entities to be discussed sufficiently small. 
- 
It is good that users are consulted so well and consistently already in the planning phase. Only in this way can the most functional service and system be developed. 
- 
In the future, it would be good to know in which direction the development is going and to provide feedback on them. 
- 
The need to map the needs of different actors and use cases in detail and define what different solutions need to be developed so that authorization 
and maintenance is smooth for all types of users 
- 
A clearly run workshop. Have a good weekteasing.  Schedule details are good 
I drove to the information. More detailed plans to discuss next. 
- 
Let's put together, summarize, think about a roadmap towards implementation. The needs are multi-
set, so maybe it's worth dividing into small groups because each type of party has its own challenge
in front of his tea in his own way. 
- 
Now with IT professionals and experts from business, there is a point somewhere 
reason to say that now the solutions are so-called clear and will be transferred to IT to implement. 
- 
A realistic, rough schedule with transition times.
