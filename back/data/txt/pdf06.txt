Opening the meeting, stating the attendees and the agenda 
Marko reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. The development issues discussed last time
regarding dotus #36, it was clarified that it would only be the name of the bank, not the bank account
litieton, addition to address information. Regarding development proposal #248, it was stated that the proposal 
have to come back again, because related challenges have still been identified that cannot be obtained 
treated with just instructions. In addition, the ongoing customer information was discussed 
about industry commenting and the possibility to review quality-related documentation 
a summary of the comments before the SÄTI days, so that the results could be used for
dessa (a presentation on the subject coming from Pia). It was agreed that the summary will be reviewed soon 
with a couple of weeks after the end of the commenting period.  
The development group was also asked about the end of Datahub that appeared on social media
about the survey related to the customer portal and whether this may affect future follow-up
development work to influence the development of other things. Marko said that this can be done by some 
partly affects other development, but the end customer portal is in charge of a different team than 
Datahub development team. Development proposals concerning the end customer portal are brought to nor-
as usual, for processing by the development working group, and the first proposals are intended to be hand-
in the development group in the fall at the latest.

Current overview of Datahub 
Customer service news 
Nelli reviewed the current affairs of customer service. The tickets were processed at the beginning of the year 
congestion, but the situation has improved after prioritization, and now tickets are open 
only 63. The service level of the telephone service is still excellent. In the development work group,
it was decided that data protection tickets would be prioritized in congested situations, and it was stated that this way
I already do.   
The balance sheet error calculation will be carried out from April 12, 2024. Correction of unchanged measurement data
in order to ignore them in the calculation, a correction has been installed in Datahub on 19.3.2024 
should prevent the problems caused by a large amount of unchanging measurement data delivered to the Datahub
toa has previously caused a balance error calculation.  
In addition, Nelli went through the process of deleting open transactions. Events can be requested 
to be removed individually and also as mass removals, but the primary importance is to find out 
in the minds of the parties, why there are open events left in the system.  
Current affairs of the development team

Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision 
4.1  
Recommendation from the working group (whether items are recommended for further development process
in), applies to the following points in the list of development proposals, the solution proposal attached
in "Appendix 3 Datahub change requests 20240229": 
4.1.1  
Development proposal #30, Real-time status of the place of use in CMS 
Laura went through the proposal, according to which the connection status of the place of use should be updated 
to CMS in real time. The connection status is updated at the indicated moment of connection or disconnection 
according to, but currently the user interface shows the status of the access point (and other information)
as of the beginning (midnight) of the review day. The purpose is to change the default
as the review time used at the time of search for all similar searches in Datahub. 
You can still search for the information for another desired time by specifying this as a search condition. 
Summary: The development group supported mefrom the outside. 
4.1.2  
Development proposal #51, Include user interface error codes in the AVR document 
Laura went through a proposal related to documentation improvement, according to which the industry 
error codes related to the user interface will be added to the published FD.CMD.AVR document as well as 
the validations of measurement data currently presented in a separate document.

Summary: The development group supported the change. 
4.1.3  
Development proposal #318, Changing the customer's name to the date of the customer's identifier
in connection with the 
Nelli went through the proposal related to the problem where the operator's customer identification
the tea update for a new hetu does not take into account possible updates to the customer's name or
to the data, but restores the customer's original data. It is not a development
suggestion but a mistake. An article about the error has been added to the knowledge base and a news
nose The operator currently does not have a way to correct the name information, but for this
I guarantee the update of the seller's customer information in accordance with the instructions. Datahub is to be developed 
more tools for the operator to also manage such situations.  
This is a bug fix, so the recommendation round was not completed. 
Summary: Fixed a bug in the operator process.  
4.1.4  
Development proposal #59, For event DH-124-1, a new validation rule that 
the seller cannot request user group BE14 
We went back to the previously discussed proposal where it was proposed to block the validation rule 
update requests for user location information, requesting user group BE14 ('Other 
target'), because the seller should never ask for that user group and previously requests 
has come in abundance. Laura reviewed the report (Appendix 4) on how many of the requests in question
jobs are coming at the moment and it was noted that in the last three months the BE14 update
there are still plenty of requests, although the number has slightly decreased in February. 
It was concluded that the user group is important information for the parties and that the unjustified BE14 is very important information 
bad, so there is a reason to get rid of them one way or another. The group thought about whether it was possible 
it was only a matter of the problem of individual parties or systems and it was concluded that 
let's find out from which parties the update requests come from. If it's just 
a few parties, instead of adding a validation rule was seen as a better option 
instructs the relevant parties on the matter, so that the systems can be put in order in this regard. 
The group thought that the parties are not necessarily aware that their system
they send the information in question, and that the automatic request for updating the location of use may 
be connected, for example, to the notification of a new contract. The risk of adding a validation rule
the problem was that if BE14 is blocked, some other default
group, so the problem doesn't go away. However, validation may become necessary if this is not the case 
otherwise get it right.  
Summary: Let's find out the parties sending the BE14 user group and apply for the matter 
solution by contacting and instructing the parties.  
4.1.5  
Development proposal #142, Do not accept to update the annual usage estimate if the value does not 
change 
Laura went through the proposal, according to which the update event of the annual usage estimate would not be allowed
country, if it contains the information already found in Datahub, and the related statement (appendix 4), 
according to which there will be many events containing unchanged data. Development team 
at sub-working group meeting 6, a change to the update practice of the annual usage estimate was recommended 
(#271), which should bring clarity to the updates of the annual usage estimates, as long as the new one

practical implementation is provided in the systems of the parties. In the development group,
it was decided that we will wait for the effect of the new guidelines to be published and come back 
to the proposal of the validation rule again if necessary.  
Summary: Let's look at the effect of the new annual usage estimate update policy on the situation 
and we will return to the proposal for a validation rule if necessary.  
4.1.6  
Development proposal #160, Operator cancellation development 
Nelli went through the contract cancellation process used by the proposed Datahub operator 
development. The topic was discussed in the development work group last in meeting 8, when the
the possibilities to develop the process Datahu remained to be mentionedbisa so that it would not require change
sia on the part of the parties. In order to reduce the work of Datahub's customer service, possible
dolity to automate e-mail messages that are currently sent manually 
process. However, as a result of the investigation, it was concluded that because the cancellation situations related to
there are a lot of different cases and their exceptions, related to automatic messages 
too many risks that messages would be sent to the parties with incorrect content, which would confuse the process
sia and would cause additional work for everyone. Consequently, it has been decided to abandon the proposal for the time being. 
However, the topic is important, because the process in question is one of Datahub's most important customer services 
employable and the goal is to reduce the amount of manual work. The topic can be 
return if the situation regarding cancellations requiring different processing changes significantly 
for example, when cancellations of contracts brought in the migration decrease.  
Summary: The subject is not promoted at this time, but it will be returned to in the future if necessary.

4.1.7  
Development proposal #102, Search for measurement data in the user interface 
Pauliina went through the proposal related to the search for measurement data, which has been found to be
a driver-oriented problem that has not been able to be repeated and that does not require development. Thus 
therefore, the proposal is rejected.  
Summary: The proposal does not involve development, so it is rejected.  
4.1.8  
Development proposal #168, Transmission of measurement data in connection with retroactive contract changes
in the making 
Pauliina reviewed the proposal according to which Datahub should automatically send the
ongoing measurement data in connection with the initiation of retroactive contracts, as well as the development, 
which the change would require. According to Datahub's presentation, the development is not recommended, because the measurement data 
are already searchable at DH events. The development group agreed with the proposal, and no 
recommended a change to the current implementation.  
Summary: No change is made to the transmission of measurement data.  
4.1.9  
Development proposal #266, Measurement information reminders when a disconnected object is 
reported consumption 
Pauliina went through the proposal, according to which a reminder of what was reported to the disconnected object 
of consumption should be sent only once, as well as Datahub's presentation, according to which to the current one

there is no need to change the implementation. The development team agreed, and did not recommend
lut changes to the current implementation.  
Summary: No change is made to the reminder.  
4.2  
It requires a discussion in the working group and preliminary questions to be clarified, mi-
we want to proceed with the following development proposals. In the Appendix "Appendix 3 
Datahub changes wishes 20240229" background for discussion and questions
it:   
4.2.1  
Development proposal #206, New type "Communication contact information" party contact
for information 
Nelli reviewed the proposal to transfer contact information for data exchange Datahub Palvelut -
from the portal to Datahub, so that all contact information related to the parties can be found in the same place
baptize The development group saw the benefit of exporting all data to Datahub as that 
currently, information is retrieved from Datahub and based on the contact information found there as well 
inquiries related to the exchange of information are sent, for example, to the party's contract manager, 
who is often not the right contact person for the matters in question. It was discussed in the development group 
however, that even if the contact details of the data exchange were taken to Datahub, they would not be deleted
from the Services portal, as not all users who need information have access to Datahub. 
In addition, the portal would still retain the connection schedule information, so there would be information in any case 
in two places. Adding a new party type to Datahub would mean a change 
also in the parties' systems, as a new type of contact information would affect Datahub's
to long messages about party information. For this reason, the development team considered the current rat-
enough and saw the change as worthwhile only if the information was only stored or
to the Datahub, where it would be visible, but it would not be forwarded in the messages. It was found that 
the change could be reconsidered if there is otherwise a bigger change to the party information
the need. In addition, it was stated that the industry could be reminded that the exchange of information
information can be found on the Services portal.  
Summary: Let's keep the matter on the list, but not advance at this time. Let's get back to the topic if 
Datahub's management of party information will later be changed in other ways as well.
pig.  
4.3  
It requires a discussion in the working group about whether to start preparing these
more hit suggestions. At this stage, no solution has been prepared yet-
marriage proposal. In the appendix "Appendix 3 Datahub change requests 20240229" basic
for discussion:   
4.3.1  
Development proposal #32, Mutual selection of annual usage estimate and time zone information
dotting 
It was decided to find out whether there is much conflicting information in Datahub, where one-time
two annual usage estimates have been reported for this location or vice versa. If necessary, you can
to be in contact with parties whose systems contain incorrect information.

4.3.2  
Development proposal #37, Use of message ID for connection and disconnection notifications 
in mediation 
It was concluded that the matter still causes problems for sellers and the proposal is necessary. conditional
however, other events can be left out and the issue will only be promoted with DH-412- 
and for DH-422 transactions. 
4.3.3  
Development proposal #80, List of places of use of the authorized business customer 
It was concluded that the proposal is relevant and especially for large customers with numerous customers 
obtaining authorizations for places of use is challenging and time-consuming. List of places of use 
getting it from Datahub would reduce the work for everyone, when 3rd parties would not have to figure out how to
from a customer or network company. The proposal was recommended for consideration together with the other 3. 
with proposals related to the authorizations of the parties.  
4.3.4  
Development proposal #86, Energy production type visible to 3rd parties 
Based on the description of the development proposal, the development working group was not able to clarify whether 
what information is meant in the proposal. It was decided to ask the proposer to li-
information about the need.  
4.3.5  
Development proposal #87, Review date for reports 
The development team did not see the need to add the proposed information. The downloaded report vol

4.3.6  
Development proposal #88, Validation of information arriving at Datahub 
It was decided to leave the proposal until the next time. 
4.3.7  
Development Proposal #98, Development of the Open Events report 
It was stated that in terms of the review and processing of open events, the report in question does not 
is essential and it was seen as more important to develop a list of open events, which is included 
coming fixes and usability improvements in version 2.2 and 2.3. This development proposal 
decided to reject.

Development proposal #101, Changes to the measurement data search view 
The proposal was initially reviewed in the development work group, but the development proposal was left out of consideration.
the clarification of the proposal that was attached to dotus, which is why the proposal must be returned 
yet again. 
4.3.9  
Development proposal #106, Blocking a connection request if there is no previous disconnection request 
The development group concluded that problematic cases arise when, for example, sellers
erroneously send a separate connection request in connection with the move, but the group sees
according to müs, the amounts are very small. Building a validation rule is not simple
practical solution, because, for example, when changing vendors, it may be necessary to send a new vendor

a connection request, and not a disconnection request before this. It was decided to find out the ticket lift
whether the proposal is still relevant and how big a problem it is.   
4.3.10  
Development proposal #108, Review date field to be active in the place of use view

It was noted that the proposal will be kept on the list.  
4.3.11  
Development proposal #118, Report on places of use by vendor 
It was concluded that the proposal is still appropriate and related to the network's reporting needs, which 
was reviewed at the previous meeting. Let's keep the proposal on the list and bundle its processing 
to other development proposals related to network reporting.  
4.3.12  
Development proposal #124, Mandatory time step in DH-122-1 message 
It was noted that the proposal was made before version 2.0 and is related to the changes in version 2.0, and not 
the proposal is no longer relevant, as the parties have had to implement according to 2.0 
functionality. Consequently, it was decided to reject the proposal.

the proposal is no longer relevant, as the parties have had to implement according to 2.0

4.3.14  
Development proposal #137, Your connection delaysdelay in application 
The development team did not see any added value in bringing information about safe connection to Da-
to tahub. Reporting a connection delay that deviates from the time limits was not considered a problem.
mana, because Datahub also allows notification outside of the time limits, and if, for example,
in connection with the chest, the connection is not made after the customer's payment, the customer is 
contacted about it very quickly. It was also found that the current documentation is sufficient
and there is no need to change it. Consequently, it was decided to reject the proposal.  
4.3.15  
Development proposal #149, Changing the format of the usage location ID 
The development team identified challenges related to the 18-character code, but it was concluded that there were not 
the ID can be changed, unless there is a change in the law. Of course, the parties have a chance 
also use shorter passwords in their own systems. Hence the proposal 
decided to reject.

Other things

for its comparison with the corresponding end-user group, because it would be important to get information on the

the schedule is not yet known, as criteria are still expected from EV, on the basis of which 
a comparison should be made. According to preliminary information, the necessary information is not available from Datahub
