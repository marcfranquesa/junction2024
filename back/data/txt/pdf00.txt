Using Datahub
•
The availability of Datahub has greatly improved usage 
after the first three months
•
Previous unplanned datahub critical processes 
the outage occurred on 12.5. Two short breaks, total 18 min.
•
A short planned outage on June 16 at 5:30, when a repair was delivered 
to the problem that was behind the serious disruption that occurred on 1.5
•
Datahub's B2B interface response times are comparable 
stable
•
There is no noticeable increase in response times over time
•
Response times increase when the datahub processes the so-called big ones 
end customer contracts. Especially if the same customer 
contracts are processed in parallel
•
Timeouts occur from time to time, but there are no known situations where 
it is not possible to get through an individual agreement
•
The number of open service requests has decreased and 
service request response times have improved

The most significant challenges of use
•
Intermittent in the process related to the customer portal 
unreliability
•
The background process sometimes gets stuck, which results in the contract information 
are not uploaded to the portal
•
While waiting for the repair, monitoring of the use of the portal has been enhanced so that 
the problem causes as little inconvenience to users as possible
•
The quality of customer and address information is not at a sufficient level
•
Fingrid is thinking about short- and long-term ways to improve data quality 
can be improved and monitored. The topic will also be returned to in the webinar 
in terms of
•
Plenty of extra and 
unnecessary updates to customer and contract information
•
Has a negative impact on data quality
•
Unnecessary data rows cause the datahub database to fill up 
faster than expected
