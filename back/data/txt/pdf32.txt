Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision  
3.1  
Recommendation from the working group (whether items are recommended for further development process
in), applies to the following points in the list of development proposals, the solution proposal attached
in you Appendix 1 and "Appendix 2 Datahub change requests 20240527": 
3.1.1  
Development proposals related to the authorization process (#406, #337, #336, #184, #335, 
#39, #81, #216, #377, #80, #394, #298, #339, #381, #411) 
Laura K reviewed the concept presentation related to authorization changes (Appendix 1 KTR14_Authorization-
muutosten_konseptointi), which contains development proposals related to authorizations 
as a whole. The guiding factor for the development of the authorization process is the EU Commission's
implementation decree 2023/1162, whose deadline is January 5, 2025. Implementing Decree-
the reference model it contains brings the following development needs to datahub: 
1. The identified end customer must identify the party to whom the authorization is given, 
and authorize it. In Datahub's current process, the party has the right to send business
akka's authorization to the datahub on behalf of the customer, but this will no longer be possible in the future 
to do, but also the business customer must give authorization directly to Datahub. Five-
according to the model, the party to be authorized can, however, send the authorization
a request that the client can accept (development proposals #406, #337). 
2. The party meeting the requirements (authorized party) must be able to decide for himself 
authorization, for example when the customer relationship ends. Currently, consumer customers 
authorizations cannot be decided by the party in datahub, but this 
is only up to the customer himself. In practice, the necessary change is that the
decisions are allowed for all parties, both the interface and the user interface 
through (development proposals #336 and #184).  
3. The licensee (i.e. Datahub) must provide the end customer with a log of all data transfer
(development proposal #335). 
According to the authorization concept, in addition to the development needs arising from the previous reference model 
datahub's authorization process is proposed to be developed with the help of the following entities
either: 
• 
A separate authorization service will be implemented, to which the party could be directed as part of the customer 
digital process or through a link to give/accept authorization (development
suggestions #39, #81, #216 and #377)  
• 
Customer-level authorization, in which case it is possible to apply for all the customer's places of use 
and sends the authorization to several places of use at a time. Customer-specific authorization
there has been a discussion with FG's legal department, according to the customer's position
nor can the authorization given by the customer apply to the customer's future places of use, because the reference model
according to li, in connection with the granting of the authorization, the customer and the place of use must be able to
to distend. According to the legal department, the "light authorization" presented in the concept, whose basic
it is possible for the party to retrieve a list of the customer's moments from the data hub 
of places of use without a place-of-use authorization is possiblestandard operating procedure 
(development proposals #80, #394, #298, #339, #381).

Re-examination of the validity of authorizations, "for a maximum of 2 years" -may-
there is no legal basis for the mass condition, but it has been decided in the planning phase to limit the
most often based on discussions with ET (development proposal #411). 
The group commented that getting authorization from customers who have even thousands 
places of use, is really challenging in practice. The possibility of a solution was brought up, 
where the customer could give the authorized party suomi.fi authorization to act as a customer
also on behalf of, i.e. in practice the customer authorizes the party to act on behalf of the data
in the direction of the hub, i.e. to accept authorizations. The practice is common e.g. financial management
in which the customer authorizes the financial management partner to handle financial affairs on behalf of
i guarantee. This would allow the authorization processes to scale. 
The group commented on the border point authorizations and that they can only be done for a maximum of
dex, it takes a lot of work in companies to keep track of deadlines for the year. It was agreed that the border
related development proposals will be brought to the next development work group. 
Removal of the time limit for authorizations, i.e. the possibility of authorizations that are valid until
dolling, got support in the group. It was seen that the person giving the authorization should himself 
determine whether the authorization is temporary or indefinite. Authorizations can be
to be audited on behalf of datahub and with process improvements to improve authorization management
taa (e.g. deciding) in practice. 
It was also discussed that the change in the authorization process applies to both third parties and 
sellers in the tender situation, both that and the relationship of existing authorizations
it has not been thought about yet, but will be specified as the planning progresses. The group was brought out 
European digital identity, which was also discussed at the Säti days. This has been addressed 
in the datahub internally, and we intend to come back to this later. 
The group also pointed out that the service provider should be authorized 
also in more detail to the contract information. Marko stated that there are development proposals related to these 
intended to be reviewed at the next meeting. 
Summary: Let's move forward with proposals for changes related to the authorization process-
in accordance with the concept description presented opposite. To be investigated as part of the work suomi.fi authorization
the use of The implementation schedule of the authorization functionalities will also be announced
hemmin, but they won't be included in versions 2.3 or 2.4 yet. 
3.1.2  
Development Proposal #129, Authorization Process 
It was found that this is the same need as the previously reviewed development proposal #55. 
3.1.3  
Development Proposal #353, Authorization Process 
Laura M went through a flaw in the hookup process. When the under-construction site of use uses
anyone, the date of the existing authorization is moved to match in datahub 
date of connection. There is currently no notification of this to the authorized party. 
It is implemented by adding a corresponding message about the change of authorization to the process, which here 
is currently sent to the authorized party in other processes.  
Summary: Let's take the development proposal forward.

3.1.4  
Development Proposal #356, Authorization Process 
The third party currently does not have access through the datahub user interface to the border
to the points, and therefore not to their measurement data. Can be extended by third parties 
access rights also apply to those border points and their measurement data to which the party 
is authorized. 
Summary: Let's take the development proposal forward. 
 
3.1.5  
Development Proposal #376, Authorization Process 
In the contract termination cancellation process, it has been noticed that when returning the status
net, which was at the place of use before termination, authorizations are currently not returned 
into force as it should. In the implementation, the contract would be reinstated 
authorizations decided and canceled in connection with the application, if they have been used
calla before deciding. 
Summary: The group saw this as a bug fix that needs to be fixed. Let's develop
proposal forward. 
3.1.6  
#382 (Fingrid), customer information management  
Nelli went through a development proposal related to a situation where the customer's data remains 
to the history as incorrect when the customer has been notified of an updatee.g. for an incorrect name
to me, and which are then repaired. In the proposal, retroactives would be enabled for the operator 
customer data error corrections. The corrections would also send messages to the parties. I use-
an "update - vendor" button would be implemented in the user interface for operator use.  
The group commented that the functionality would be extremely good, because in certain ti-
in lanti, the seller doesn't even know what the correct customer information is, and the operator can access it 
always see the entire update history. It was also said that repair needs will be updated
full, and thus these could be repaired directly with one tick. It was also found that the operative
should be able to make all kinds of repairs. In addition, it was reminded that just
the cause of errors should always be corrected first. 
Summary: Let's take the development proposal forward. 
3.1.7  
#365 (Fingrid), end user interface 
Nelli reviewed the development of the customer portal and energy reporting authorizations 
development proposal. Energy reporting-type authorization can only be given by a 3rd party
lelle, but the customer can currently also select sellers and networks from the user interface
in addition to other parties, the ordinary end customer does not know in which role which company
mii as a service provider.  
Summary: The group saw this as a bug fix that should be carried forward. Thing-
the issuing of the kasportal authorization must be changed so that it is not possible to choose part-
side and authorization type, which cannot be given to a party.

3.1.8  
Development proposal #388, calculations 
Suvi initiated the development proposal related to energy community calculations. About the results of calculations 
accuracy is not defined separately in the documentation, such as measurement data, and datahub 
deliver the results of the calculations unrounded.  
The group commented that in practice the party must always know how to round themselves 
results after their receipt, and the results cannot therefore be used as such.  
Summary: The accuracy of the calculations in the data hub should be changed to the same when it is determined
tented for measurement data. Let's take the development proposal forward. 
3.1.9  
Development Proposals #403 and #409, Product Process 
Marko said that the user interface change needed for the VAT change is being aimed at 
to get into production early enough, no later than August 1, 2024. Through the B2B interface, the price
jen update is already successful at this moment. 
The group commented that the industry needs better information about the VAT change. 
Currently, it is not known that any party uses the product data stored in the data hub
information in their own invoicing, but as soon as you use it, there are problems when the products and 
their prices do not match. We would like instructions for the newsletter and a link on how to
half know how to make these corrections, because updating the prices is not necessarily
also done. 
The need to temporarily remove the normal time limit for the update process was discussed 
(30 days). Nelli said that the price update has been reviewed today in the topical webinar 
and the information will also go out in the next newsletter: the 30-day time limit will be removed in August
for a month.  
Summary: The change proposal is already being implemented, and the guidance of the parties is being improved. 
3.1.10  
#404 (Fingrid), Measurement data management,    
Development proposal for a new measurement data reminder, where once a month a reminder would
notice, if the party has missing measurements going back a year.  
The group saw a need for a reminder, because currently sellers have to ask questions 
after the missing measurements several times and they are also received with Excel in order to get
I give the customer an invoice. 
In the discussion, it became clear that the quality view of the datahub user interface does not display reliably 
information. It was agreed that we would come back to this matter later. In addition to the quality view, reminder
there is a need for it from the point of view of the networks, but a month is too short a reminder interval, 
because the sellers already have time to ask for the missing ones in between. 
The group commented that the reminder should not just generate more spam. Suggestions-
a survey was conducted for the industry, both networks and sellers. It was also seen that the number of reminders
it is easier to see who is missing measurement data, possibly con-
image, and through that, measures can be taken.

Togetherveto: The development proposal was seen as good, but we will still conduct a survey on the need
to the sector where the need is ensured. In any case, the reminder interval should be less than a month

3.1.11

Laura M initiated a proposal according to which a notification would be sent to the network, while not to the seller 
corrected time series will no longer be sent 6 weeks after the end of the contract, and the network 
the share of sales should be corrected. We discussed how this proposal is seen in relation to
to development proposal #167. The group saw that #167 should be implemented as possible
as quickly as possible, and this proposal can be implemented separately later.  
There were different opinions among the group about the need to implement the development proposal. On the net 
has its own implementations for handling situations. The group commented that the underemployed
who could you ask about the capabilities of the systems and the opinion of the main user forum. 
Summary: Let's keep the development proposal still on the list and start promoting the main use-
through the jäforum and sub-working group. 
3.2  
It requires a discussion in the working group and preliminary questions to be clarified, mi-
we want to proceed with the following development proposals. In the appendix "Appendix 2

Summary: It was jointly stated that the current development in version 2.1 is sufficient and not 
this needs to be promoted. 
3.2.2  
Development Proposal #307, Calculations,    
Development proposal for dividing balance sheet error calculations according to tax rates. The group was one-
minded by need. 
Summary: The operator runs the following balance error calculations in accordance with the development proposal
in installments. 
3.2.3  
Development proposals #326 and #415, contract process  
Laura K introduced the proposal that a new reason code (AR07) is needed for cancellation. 
ET's future instructions "Termination of electricity supply due to reasons attributable to the seller" 
the corresponding action requires in canceling the use of the code. A new cancellation is introduced 
also in mass cancellations made by the operator. The previous agreement will never be returned
effective in these cancellations.

The open questions were reviewed: 
1. Can the cancellation be made retroactively? Retroactive cancellation is required e.g. con-
in course cases, because the bankruptcy date may be a few days in the past. 
In practice, the procedure with time limits is the same as the seller's cancellation. 
2. Will the online contract be left in effect in the data hub? Yes, we will leave it, because the network will remain 
the obligation to supply the customer with electricity for 3 weeks. 
3. Are notifications from non-seller locations also blocked from cancellation events? 
Yes, it is blocked in the same way as in those concluded with reason AN05. 
4. Will authorizations be revoked? However, when the online contract remains, the customer can
mass. Authorizations are not revoked. 
5. According to ET, the new termination and cancellation codes should not be used for fusion status
in the roads. What are the practical use cases? Bankruptcy cases or if any seller 
terminate the sale without a merger.  
Summary: The development proposal can be refined based on the discussion and 
let's move forward. 
3.2.4  
Development Proposal #389, Contract Process,    
Nelli reviewed the change proposal related to the documentation of retroactive contract exchanges. 
Would 3.5 years retroactively be allowed also for this reason for starting the contract? Yes.  
Summary: The guidelines are being clarified so that retroactive changes of contracts are possible
list to make a maximum of 3.5 years retroactively.

the following points in the dotus list, the proposed solution in the appendix "Appendix 2 Datahub

Development proposal #390, calculations, 
Marko presented a development proposal for controlling the size of outgoing time series data. Tu-
instructions regarding newspaper sizes, which will be limited with this, so that 
large files would not cause any challenges. 
There was also a discussion about the size and quantity limitations of incoming messages. At this moment-

Version 2.4 design – Appendix 3 
Marko introduced those in the development queue tentatively planned for version 2.4items (Appendix 3 
Datahub version 2.4 planning). Necessary changes are planned for the version, 
which should be included in the version: #316, #384, #347, #390. Marko visited them

arguments through. In addition, there are many items in the development queue and not all of them are possible

why. 
 
The group clearly took the position that the improvements identified through customer information management
set should be included in version 2.4 in its entirety. After that, the most important
made the following development proposals in this order: #382, #326, #276 #156+#186, 
#110. Regarding the others, it was stated that it is possible to live, even if they are not available in version 2.4. 
 
Marko also asked how the group sees datahub's version delivery cycle in the future. Group 
saw that the major version delivery twice a year for those with direct industry impact is 
suitable, if only the version would get more content/changes than what is there now 
received. It was pointed out that the testing and review of each version is its own small project and 
laborious efforts, which will also incur significant costs, and one does not want the data
the hub's version testing is constantly on. In that sense, it would be important to get a bigger one 
scope of changes at once, while testing is carried out for each version. For some 
group members would have the opportunity to deliver several times a year.

Other things  
5.1  
Development proposal #176:  
Suvi asked about the status of the agreed industry survey regarding development proposal #176. Marko stated, 
that he hasn't been forgotten, but he has had to prioritize other things over this. Let's try 
to process it during autumn 2024. 
 
5.2  
Quick couplings 
Pia said that there has been a discussion in the ET group regarding the connections of the places of use, and 
found out that some of the network companies gave up quick connections. Problems are caused by the fact that 
some sellers direct customers to the networks if the electricity is cut off at the place of use. It is proposed to 
that in DHP you could see the connection table without logging in, in which case the network company 
connection times, prices, etc. would be more readily available. You don't want to give access to everyone
login prompts. The company's contact information is behind the login, and it should be, 
but the connection table would be better served if it were publicly available. 
Marko stated that the proposal will be written down and an internal discussion will be held. 
5.3  
Greetings from Säti days 
Pia gave feedback from the Säti days:  
• 
In the field, it is generally felt that the development is slow for the data hub, but also for its own ATJ 
regarding.  
• 
Regarding guidance needs: Customer information has changed, but there is no information on who to ask 
to fix. If another seller updates the information of a common customer, no update 
the recipient has no information about who made the update. At worst 
the web bombards the wrong seller. The end result may be that someone has to

Energy community calculations and spaces for use under construction 
Marko and Laura M initiated an issue that is under development, which is related to community accounting's other

where the question has arisen about possible members of the community in a disconnected state, 
for which no measurement data is supplied (0 series). Datahub's system provider has suggested, 
that these targets would be forced to deliver a series of 0, followed by a community census 
would also be carried out for these. The group's view on this was asked. 
According to the group's view, the delivery of the 0 series to the disconnected location of use is mit-
contrary to the principles of the foundation, and this is not how we want to act. A more correct way would be that the calculationa 
would know how to manage these members in a disconnected state. 
Laura M stated that, based on this feedback, we will continue the discussion about CGI as well 
with.
