Service contract availability changes – Appendix 3 
Marko went through Datahub's proposed changes to the appendices of the service agreement. 
The group commented that the datahub's instructions should include a process description, how 
exclusion of the party from the data hub is done, but there is no need to include it 
to the service contract appendices. You also have to think to what level process description is necessary 
to do, not necessarily to a detailed level. Communication on the matter should also be described 
as part of the process. Otherwise, there were no comments from the group regarding the change conditions for the availability item.

Regarding other changes to the service contract, the group came up with a proposal from section 2.1 that it would be 
these are better to be attached with French lines. Now quite a bit heavy to read and would be 
easier to use and better to maintain if the document set changes.  
Other changes to the service contract. Section 4.3: A conflict was raised about the group

There were no other comments from the group regarding other changes to the service contract change conditions

necessary, the implementation of the notification is taken into account in the same context 
also for the web.  
The survey is supposed to be sent to the parties during May with a response time of one month, so that 
the answers will be received before the summer holidays. In the distribution of the questionnaire, e.g. head

Industry comments on changes in the development of customer information quality management – 
Appendix 5 
Marjut Huotari went through the comments from the industry and, based on them, Datahub
propose changes related to the development of customer information quality management and comment
to the documents you had, The business processes of the electricity retail market data hu-
bissa, Datahub events and Datahub Name and Address structure instructions.  
Datahub's Name and Address structure instructions: 
2.1 Addresses in the form of postal addresses should be deleted from the section "If necessary". Not to this 
comments from the group. 
Chapter 2 address structure: The group concluded that in YTJ all customers' contact
the information is not necessarily correct, the customer's name is. There was a discussion in the group, 
can the entry into force period of the information be used in YTJ to determine the correctness of the information
in it and it was stated that based on that, one cannot be sure of the correctness of the information. Mouth-
rem customers' information is usually fine in YTJ, and they have problems connecting
regarding the correctness of data management. The group concluded that the information also in some other
in real situations, they update to YTJ with a rather long delay. The group concluded that there is no reason to refer 
only as a source of correct information for YTJ. The group's proposal was "Corporate customers' postal
the address must be the address of the main office. Addresses of possible separate locations
dot is maintained in the contract information (billing address). Some business customers maintain an active
address information in YTJ for the main office or on their own website". 
Introduction paragraph update: No comments from the group. 
Sections 3 and 4 customer's e-mail address and phone number:  
The group proposed the following wording to replace the proposed change:
with akka, the address must be a general email address/phone number. Company contact
the person's information is maintained in the contract information. 
Section 5 Billing address: The group was also asked about changes in the terms of online services
because, does it affect this. It was stated that there will be no change regarding this point. Group 
stated that there is no need for changes to the proposed wording. 
Section 2.4 customer address:  
The group commented that a customer can have three different addresses in a certain situation. 
The address of the place of use is always included on the invoice. A business customer of several different offices 
there is no place for addresses in datahub, unless the address in question is a billing address. Group eh-
dotti not to make the proposed change to this section (can only confuse the reader), but 
let's bring it up through an example, in the form of Fingrid. 
Section 3.1 consumer customers: The group concluded that the proposed change is appropriate, only
guarantee that we write open DVV. YTJ could also be written open elsewhere in the document. 
Section 2.2 detailed instructions for the street address: The group stated that it could be used to pre-
in the sign "Saaristo" the address because the street is usually expected to have a house number.

Where should Poste Restante be recorded?: No comments from the group on the proposal 
that there is no change to the current guidelines. 
The business processes of the electricity retail market in the data hub:  
Section 3.1.2 DH-110 Maintenance of customer information: The group stated that the same texts are not repeated
you, but we refer to the section of the instruction document that contains an example, thus easier to maintain
this, if there are any changes. 
3.1.2.2. Correctness and maintenance of customer data: The same comments from the group as before
to that point.  
Business processes document comments, additional DH messages: About group 
an example was given where the customer has two vendors and in the data hub the second vendor's storage
Mana is misinformation. The network company does not receive the sellers' information. Online still own, van-
outdated information. Datahub has been in use for more than two years, can you hang on to customers who 
several sellers, and no one has noticed any mistakes. The determination of customer data update requests
rags can be in the hundreds every day. 
In the past, extra messages have meant rounding up customer information, so no 
reason to mix this up.  
If the proposed change were to be made, it would cause a need for change in the industry's systems 
to check the changes against datahub. 
The group concluded that there is no need to change the current design, i.e. no proposals are made
that design. The issue will also be discussed at the SÄTI days. The goal is to get rid of it 
large masses of erroneous events. 
Datahub events: 
Datahub transactions Section 4.1 Customer data update - seller: Rone stated that 
we refer to the same instruction as already mentioned above. 
4.2. and 4.3 – JVH and 3rd party: The group stated that also for these, the reference to the instruction 
respectively. 
Section 4.4 DH-114 notice on updating the customer's identifier: No com-
ments for the proposed change to be made to the business documentation.

Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision 
7.1  
Recommendation from the working group (whether items are recommended for further development process
in), applies to the following points in the list of development proposals, the solution proposal attached
in you Appendix 6 and "Appendix 7 Datahub change requests 20240422": 
7.1.1  
Development proposal #280, Comparison of the average of the corresponding end-user group 
with the end user 
Marko introduced the situation of the development proposal. There has been no response from EV to numerous contact
samples regardless of how the end-user group is defined for comparison and data-
the hub's user group does not meet the need because the average would be calculated on the basis of
vin according to apartments with different energy use. Fingrid Datahub is also a dispatch
made an official request for instructions to EV because it is EV's responsibility to issue instructions on this. 
It was concluded from the group that the legal provisions are added to the invoices sent by the parties and the guidelines
I guarantee customers to check the situation on datahub's end customer portal. Thus, as a problem 
is that the section of the law is not fulfilled if that information cannot be compared in the data hub. The group stressed that 
there should be a solution to this and soon. 
Regarding the group, it was stated that the user groups of the datahub were originally formed by Statistics
on the basis of grouping. From the group, it was suggested that the current user group
online using the annual usage estimate. For example, Apartment buildings under 5000 kWh/year, over 5000 
kWh, etc... Similarly, for single-family houses, in a similar way. This would be, at least in the short term,
solution of the table. Tentatively planned solution planned with Statistics Finland 
can also be promoted. Regarding the group, it was concluded that the end-user grouping can be updated 
e.g. once a year for old places of use and once a month for new ones 
end user groupings are obtained for comparison. The group also highlighted the fuse
using size for groupings, but it was also noted that for these data, the data 
the level of maintenance varies between companies. 
The group also stated that they have already started making their own solutions, but when the final
nen solution can be found in Datahub, then we will move on to using it. Of the group, highlight-
the importance of one centralized solution was emphasized. 
Summary: The development team recommended that a solution be made soon based on the data hub 
to the user group and the annual usage estimate and continue with the direction of the Statistics Finland's alternative
scolding. 
7.2  
It requires a discussion in the working group and preliminary questions to be clarified, mi-
we want to proceed with the following development proposals. In the Appendix "Appendix 7 
Datahub changes wishes 20240422" background for discussion and questions
it:   
7.2.1  
Development proposal #88, Validation of information arriving at Datahub 
Tomi initiated the development proposal. It would be easier to check how from the user interface 
a lot of invoice line information has been sent. Tomi stated that the point is that when invoice line data 
are sent and if they are sent via Datahub in the future, the amount per network may increase 
to high. In practice, it would be best and easiest to look at these from the user interface. Tom

stated that we are talking about thousands of lines per month. Datahub stated that the user
there is no change to the connection in terms of line restrictions (performance issue). 
 
The group stated that the issue is still topical and could be handled with a report. From the group 
it was also pointed out that the report could be run based on a certain date and also sell
again, this would be useful, you would see "this much has been sent", i.e. how much has come online 
this information. 
 
 
7.2.2  
Development proposal #101, Changes to the measurement data search view 
The group commented that datahub has already been implemented in the latest version
data feature and it is also possible to download the data to Excel. Datahub still ensures this
internally and we are in contact with the ticket holder to see if the current solution is sufficient. Eh-
otherwise, there is no need to move forward with dotus. 
 
7.2.3  
Development Proposal #155, USeamma's place of use/customer/contract information search 
at once 
The group commented that this has been a challenge, especially in small-scale production
in terms of equipment. The change to the data hub can be big, but it was stated that the change will be investigated 
scope. 
 
7.2.4  
Development proposal #158, Customer portal error message is not descriptive 
Pauliina said that the end customer's error had occurred during the datahub's disruption situation and 
no other similar situations have been encountered. The group concluded that error messages could 
be clearer so that the user can understand them. Datahub can check what the error messages are 
tasks. 
 
7.2.5  
Development proposal #173, Management of members of energy communities to the data hub 
Pia stated that this ET's previous proposal had now been asked again and it was stated that this 
there is no need for change. The group agreed. Marko also stated that here is 
chicken-and-egg problem, i.e. community members cannot be managed in datahub until it is pe-
connected to the data hub, but it cannot be set up until the administrative members are agreed. Marko 
stated that there are also separate commercial solutions for this. 
 
7.2.6  
Development proposal #214, User numbers of the parties' customers in the data hub 
The group concluded that this would be good information especially for the network. Some networks are strategic
logically aligned that they will direct end customers to the datahub's customer portal, in which case the online
koa is interested in how many of their customers log in there. This information could also be 
in the "customer letter". This could be taken into account in the development of the end customer portal.

The group commented on this that the system supplier had received an inquiry about this, that 
does VKA have to be calculated for production locations, there has been no guidance on this. 
Marko stated that Fingrid also needs to obtain small production sites 
total information (based on nominal power). 
 
The group concluded that it is good to take the matter to a sub-working group in order to understand the impact of
from the point of view of editors. The group concluded that the term "annual usage estimate" would also work 
new, because this term specifically refers to consumption and not income. It isn't 
to be decided by this group. The group also pointed out that a more frequent measurement cycle 
in the world, the role of the annual use estimate has decreased, but a new one is still needed 
in the customer's case. The group stated that the new production use locations should be taken into account 
in connection with the annual usage estimate instructions, so that it is not necessary to update it in order to obtain
I give them clear instructions and update annual usage estimates with a sufficient cycle. 
 
• 
Change in the VAT rate 
Tomi brought up the upcoming change in the VAT rate: how this will be instructed and implemented
terrestrial? Tomi stated that in his own notes, Alvi's transformation should be done 
with completely new products 30 days before the VAT rate change. would the change be successful
only with the DH-714 event, or does it require heavier changes? Would we have to? 
to make all the products new or can the price information changes be received by DH-714-
saying? Marko showed development proposal #9, which has already been implemented in version 1.9.0, which 
seems to be related to the same issue and solves this situation at least partially
by dollarizing the update of the tax rate of the product component. The new change has already
hit proposal (#403) to allow the use of decimals in tax rate information. 
 
Pauliina stated regarding the calculation of balance sheet errors that the VAT change brings its own com-
a trick when there are three different VAT rates. Tomi stated that in practice this means 
to them (the networks) that they have to separate several different VATs themselves. 
The group was asked on what schedule these VAT changes are coming? Marko stated that 
the datahub system provider has already been warned about these and that this will be delivered 
in autumn at the latest (September 1, 2024 deadline set by the Finnish government).
