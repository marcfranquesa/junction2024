According to one of the cases in the UC.DDQ.REQ.ACP.ID test, we need to 
implement accounting point search using related accounting point identification 
(RAP). As we understand the test, we should provide the DDQ an option that if 
an AP is found using regular address based search and if the AP has a related 
AP that did not appear in the original search, then the DDQ can find the related 
AP using RAPI. However, at the moment the search requires that both post 
office (city) and street name are present in the search keywords. I think the 
search would be much more useful, if it would allow searching by RAPI only. This 
way the DDQ can always retrieve an AP by knowing the address of the related 
AP. For instance, in some rare cases, the AP might be located on the edge of a 
county and the AP and related AP can have quite different addresses. If we 
always require some address information in the search, then in most cases it is 
easier for the DDQ to search by address only, since it must be more or less 
known anyway.

It has been recognized that all grid products are not possible to represent in the 
Datahub data model, especially complex ones - these could be e.g. products 
with different kinds of Peak power calculation rules. This is of course fine. 
However, the grid product code is mandatory in the grid agreement confirmation 
event, DH-312. So, there will be products which are not represented in the 
Datahub, but they are referred to in the event. There are the requirements and 
validations on the event "The product reported for the agreement must be found 
in Datahub, be in effect when the agreement starts and belong to the reporting 
market party.". How is this Supposed to be handled? Is it expected that some 
sort of dummy products, without any product components, should be 
established? Note that this doesn't seem to be possible currently, according to 
the cardinality in the Data Standard.

The change is needed because the original 
the planned model causes companies 
manual steps and is for the customer 
confusing because the customer will 
send another confirmation of this new one 
due to the contract. There are situations 
estimated to be 100,000 – 150 annually 
000 pcs. The amount of manual work is 
massive.  
Datahub has already been implemented in the system 
according to the original specification 
functionality. You have to get into the system 
to build a logic connection statement 
on the basis of the contract 
to a change in the effective date.

A filter for event type (corresponding to the "Transaction Type" in the message 
details, e.g. "DH-311-1") would be very useful, crucial even, since using the 
"Message type" filter is quite cumbersome to use due to the one to many 
relationships between message types and event types (one message type is 
used for many event types), and thus, doesn't provide detailed enough filtering.

For online contract confirmation, check that the sale and the online contract are at the same time 
at the customer. There is currently no customer in the confirmation of the online contract. 
This does not prevent the situation where the network makes a network contract for a different customer. 
The network can have a different customer in its own system than in the hub. So it is 
it is entirely the network's responsibility to ensure that the contract goes to which customer 
will be reported in the DH-311-2 message. 
New validation that grid and sales contracts are the same 
end customer when confirming the grid contract. At the 
moment there is no end customer in the confirmation of 
the grid contract. This does not prevent that situation 
DSO could do the grid contract for different end customers. 
DSO can have in own system different than end customer 
in datahub. That means that it is on DSO's responsibility 
to make sure that the contract is done for the end customer 
that was informed in the event DH-311-2.

Did we have guidelines when the DSO should update the estimated annually 
consumption when a new sales agreement is created? 
If we don't have those yet, would it be possible to write those so that the DSO 
needs to update the EYC after the new sales agreement has become valid? 
Reasoning is that then the new supplier would get the updated information. 
If the SAO updates the EYC when a new sales agreement is forwarded, the new 
supplier does not get the new EYC in DH-122-2 or DH-122-4. 
Building a scheduled DH-132 for the new supplier seems counter intuitive since 
the data could be forwarded to the new supplier. It also causes unnecessary 
messages if the new supplier starts to query the updated ACP data every day 
until the new sales agreement is valid.

1 The change would be a big change in principle 
in the datahub if the notification is about the place of use 
of the change would be sent to a new one 
to the seller before the valid one 
agreement. And on the other hand, the change of JVH 
in processes would be big if wanted 
notice to datahub only 
after the commencement of the sales contract. 
We'll see if there's a need 
to think about something 
detour, e.g. 
e-mail message to the seller 
when the information is updated.

Development condition

The wish that in the sales agreement search results (search sales agreement results) 
the end date of the contract would be displayed. 
But it would be nice to have a stop date and reason in the Search Sales line, so 
one don't have to open the specific sales agreement for a quick check. But that's it 
probably for later developments. Just a quick wish.

For example, mandatory ones are not highlighted/starred in the billing address form

it would be great if the form had the functionality to highlight them

customer type.
The mandatory fields are not highlighted or marked with 
stars e.g. in the invoicing address form even there is some 
mandatory field to be filled in. User get notification about 
missing fields when trying to submit the form. In the 
customer data fill is also missing the required mandatory

dynamically highlight the mandatory fields that are

The functionality for searching for business messages is good because it allows you to monitor the number of messages and what types of messages have been processed. We have been a little disappointed that we have not received them in quantities in such a way that we could calculate how much of each message has been processed by message type. In other words, the functionality 
"export.csv" is missing. Yesterday, when I was examining the user interface a little more closely, I noticed that the button is there, if you are really careful. The button can be found when you zoom in close enough to the right edge of the search results, and you can notice that a faint line appears in the user interface. When you manage to click on it, the buttons also open, as is the case with other search results, and this way you can also export the search data to a csv file for further analysis. It might be a good idea to check with the system supplier how to make that button more visible, because I believe that other parties might also need that feature. Attached are images, one of which shows a line that you have to click to find the button. 17.6.2021 0 1 Finding the button in question is difficult. Changing the button's 
styling would make the button 
more visible and easier to 
find.
The 
styling of the button in question is not a major change.

Improvement ideas for the 'List Open Transactions' page:
1. It would be good if the created timestamp showed not only the date but also the 
time. This way you can go through the open transactions in order. 
2. It would be good if the view could be dragged to the entire screen. So you could see 
more transactions at a time. 
3. It would be good if it counted how many transactions there are.
4. It would be good if you click on a row and it would appear in a color other than gray. 
Now it is very difficult to see where you have clicked when everything is gray. 
The differences in the gray tone are not visible enough.
Development ideas to the 'List Open Transactions' page:
1. Create time stamp could present also time besides the 
date.
2. It should be possible to maximize the whole view full 
screen size. More events at one screen.
3. The number of events presented.
4. The selected row could be visualized with different 
colour than grey. That would help the see where the 
selection is at the moment. It is difficult to see differences 
in the hues of grey.

According to the GDPR, the data subject has the right to restrict the processing of his/her data.
According to the Data Protection Regulation (art 18), the data subject has the right in certain situations to obtain from the data controller restriction of processing. Restriction of processing under the GDPR means that the data can still be stored, but for other processing (such as the transfer of data), there must be a specific basis provided for in the GDPR (e.g. consent of the data subject, processing to protect the rights of another party). 
In relation to Datahub, the only basis for restricting processing under the GDPR is that the data subject disputes the accuracy of the personal data. According to the GDPR, processing must then be restricted until the controller has been able to verify the accuracy of the data.
According to the GDPR, the registered has rights to limit the handling of her/his data.
According to the data privacy art 18, the registered has in certain situations the right that the registry owner limits the handling of data. That means that those data can still be stored in the datahub, but for other handling (like e.g. abandonment of data) shall require a specific justification as legislated in data privacy art (like registered approval, handling data to protect other person's rights). In datahub case the only handling limitation justification, according to the data privacy art, could be that registered denies the correctness of personal data. According to the data privacy art, the handling of data shall be stopped until the Registry owner has been able to make sure that the 
personal data is correct.

Customer has a fixed term contract until 13 September 2022. However, move-out was 
created for 30.9.2021. After the move-out being accepted by Datahub, customer 
informs a new invoicing address. We update it to our system and that generates 
DH-321-1. However, DH-321-1 is rejected by Datahub due to "Attribute 'Fixed 
Term End Date' must be the same as or earlier than '2021-09-30T21:00:00Z'.". As 
we are not trying to make any changes to the fixed term end date (same date is 
in the DH-321-1 as is already in the customer contract in Datahub), why is the 
message rejected? Is there a reason why Datahub is concerned about the fixed 
term end date when contract is anyway ending (and ending was successful even 
although fixed term and date is after the end date)? Could we expect changes 
coming to the rules here in the near future?
In cases of move-out getting cancelled, it would be better that the fixed term ends

The identifier field always contains the identifier of the previous message in the chain (e.g. DH-422-

the identifier seller of the DH-421-1 message sent by the seller would be used instead 
would see from this that it is a response to their request (but maybe 
mixes datahub's composite processes processing). The same situation applies

(law)
A development idea for the future of collecting consumer authorizations 
for efficiency.. Could the authorization done through the current portal 
giving "detach" Datahub into a service and a website that could be connected 
to the online services of the parties? In this case, the consumer would authorize GDPR 
from the point of view of the right party in the service (Datahub) and authorization 
giving could be connected to the situation where authorization is actually given 
is required (the party's web service). In practice, the authorization service could be 
from the user's point of view, in the same style as "pass-through service" as, for example, the current ones 
identification services or payment services where the user moves from the website 
to the other party's service and returns the necessary action 
after completing. Such or a similar service is actually a prerequisite that 
the possibilities of Datahub that are "behind" the authorization can be utilized 
in the consumer segment. What would the development idea sound like?

A development proposal from Fortum: "We have had many cases where the electricity consumption point has not been found because the grid company or we have the wrong postal code in our data. We therefore suggest that the search could also be done without the postal code by placing an asterisk (*) in the search. For example, if the address is 
Esimerkkikatu 7 C 44, 02210 ESPOO, the search could also be done in the mudo 
Esimerkkikatu 7 C 44, * ESPOO. However, if the address has other information correct 
except the postal code, then it is most likely that the search will produce the correct address. 
In our opinion, this would benefit both the seller parties and the distribution network operators. 
The Ediel.fi service also works in a similar way in the consumption point search service."
We have a lot of cases where metering point cannot be 
found because DSO or supplier has incorrect postal code 
in the address. We propose possibility to make search 
without postal code by giving asterix (*) into search.

Case: The point of use was without a vendor and disconnected. The vendor reports a new

status of the point of use (disconnected). Later, the network reports the connection retroactively, 
the connection date is the day before the start date of the agreement -> the seller does not receive information about the 
connection, because the information is only forwarded to the current seller of the point of use.

Development proposal
At the request of the system supplier, I am submitting a development request regarding the language of the customer's 
address and the contract's billing address.
Now our system works in such a way that the update of customer data is automatically processed through the system (seller master). With the current model, we get 
customer addresses mixed up in terms of language if we have 
an online customer with a service language of Swedishi and the seller sends the address in Finnish. 
These cannot be monitored/corrected in any way.
According to the system supplier, if the addresses included language, they could 
they make a comparison and in this way these cases would be caught and needed 
repairs done.
As a development, we hope to include a language code in connection with the customer's addresses and 
to messages with addresses (postal address, billing address).

As an online company, we find the cancellation code AR04 very inconvenient. AR04 code 
can be used at this time even if the seller has concluded the contract as a delivery contract. 
It can't really be like this, that the customer just cancels the sale, if that's the case 
delivery contract. So, regarding this, the data hub should have a reasoning that no 
the delivery contract can be canceled with reason AR04, or if you can, then the online contract should be 
cancel also in this context. It is not possible for the customer to receive from someone else 
a delivery contract from the seller, if the seller who is obligated to deliver already has a contract 
cancelled. 
Could the reason for this cancellation and its functionality be brought up if necessary 
again in some new development groups, we would see that this would require 
further definition/implementation towards the data hub.
As a DSO we see the cancellation code AR04 very 
complex. AR04 code can be used even supplier has 
made contract as delivery contract. That can't happen in 
real that end customer cancels only selling if there is 
delivery contract. Datahub should conclude that delivery 
contract cannot be canceled with AR04 code or if it can 
be cancelled, then the grid contract shall be canceled as well. 
It is not possible that end customers can get from others 
supplier delivery contract if delivery responsible supplier 
has already canceled the contract.
Could this cancellation reason and its rules be re-
evaluated in development workgroup. This requires new

Datahub supplies it to eSett, so is the corresponding data available in Datahub's REST

network companies authorize them separately for balance sheet managers? That is, the seller's sales

The accuracy of the measurement data
In the energy industry's electricity measurement and balance settlement working group, we discussed the accuracy of measurement data. 
Especially when switching to 15-min measurement in small objects, it would be good to recommend 1Wh recording accuracy.
Previously, it was asked if Datahub also accepts measurement data with 1Wh accuracy and then 
we were left with the understanding that measurement data could be delivered to Datahub with an accuracy of 1Wh.
This is how it is in the guide: Business processes of the electricity retail market in Datahub on page 106
"For applications with a fuse size or equivalent
the electric power is a maximum of 3x63 A, the measurement data must be reported with an accuracy of 10 watt hours. In other respects
measurement data must be reported with an accuracy of at least a kilowatt hour"
This instruction can now be interpreted so that Datahub could be delivered more accurately than 10Wh 
measurement data.
Should that instruction be updated so that it becomes clear that you can also use 1Wh accuracy, but 10Wh 
accuracy is the minimum requirement?

start date is older than -1280 (CP_AGRUPDSLS_FTS_MIN_PERIOD) or the fixed term end date is newer 
than 90 (CP_AGRUPDSLS_FTS_MAX_PERIOD).
The logic of the rule is incorrect. The rule needs to be changed so that, if the time limits of the fixed term 
start date and fixed term end date of the message are different from the dates of the agreement, then the 
date verification is done.
If the fixed term dates of the message and the agreement are the same, then the rule is not verified.

Grid agreement should be handled like the sales agreement on the accounting point so previous grid

CGI FI - Configuration Update: Grid agreement might get wrong end date after 
cancellation with reason AR01 outside the balance window and no previous agreements
In design document FD.CMD.340 scenario 7 after cancellation of the sales agreement with reason AR01 
outside the balance window and no previous agreements it is described that the canceled agreement 
remains valid during the period from the original start date of the now canceled Sales/Balance Agreement 
until the cancellation reporting date (i.e. today).  After the cancellation DH-341-2 is forwarded to the DSO 
and they are expected to cancel the corresponding grid agreement. 
In the design (3.7.4.1.2.7) it also says that grid agreement remains valid during the period from the original 
start date of the now canceled Grid Agreement until the cancellation reporting date (i.e. today). So if the 
DSO does not cancel their grid agreement on the same day as the sales agreement is cancelled, grid 
agreement gets a different end date than the sales agreement on the accounting point. This leads to DSO 
and supplier invoicing the same customer from different periods. 
The grid agreement should be ended on the same date as the sales agreement if the grid agreement is ended 
as a response to sales agreement cancellation.

CGI NL New Feature: Datahub CMS show exchange points on the None status 
list even thought there's been data for days
Change ticket created from incident INCUSE0000053906
Feature, discussed on the incident ticket, has already been designed to datahub 2.0, in CR 118
Is it possible to get this feature already in use as it already exists?
SQP Dashboard show one-directional exchange points' other measurement point on the None status list. 
On one-directional exchange point the other measurement is not active and data is not required for that.  
The in-active points should be removed from the SQP Dashboard None -status list.
Incident INCUSE0000053904 created about the same issue but on measurement data reminders.

CGI FI/NL New feature: Virtual production unit is not generated for future 
ggeneration type changes
Virtual production units are not generated in cases where DSO has changed the generation type of the 
production and sales agreement for the acp is done afterwards for the period where the "old" generation 
type is still active.
At present only the active generation type of the acp on the start date of the sales agreement is taken into 
account when creating the virtual production unit. Also possible changes in the production type in the future 
(after the start date of the sales agreement) should be taken into account. So a vPUs should be generated 
also for that production type.

Validation rule for using only capital letters in Post office in both invoicing 
address and postal address
In the Datahub Data standard it is mentioned that the post office should contain only capital letters. At the 
moment there is no validation rule for which kind of
letters are used (capital letters / lower case letters). Only capital letters should be allowed if the address is in 
Finland. For foreign addresses no validation rule should be used.

New Role for Other DDQ type of market party that only uses GUI
We have a need to create a new user role for DDQ's that are suppliers for production units, but do not 
serve the entire energy market. 
For these market parties we want to have a new user role for GUI, with a very limited set of systems 
functions.
The new role should be named OtherDDQ
The role needs to have access to search, view and receive metering (Dh-200) and Settlement (DH-500) 
data for production units. 
I tested in Conv01 the role set-up and did not manage to find the exact combination.
Below snippet of assigned sub-roles also give access to following searches, that should not be accessible 
fot these other DDQ's
accounting point, sales agreement and product
I then assigned the following system functions for the role, but then I'm missing access to meter data.
Accounting Point Get (ACP.GET)
Get time series data from kx (getcalcs) (STS.GTS)
Imbalance Settlement Data Request (STS.RTR.DDQ)
List Production Units (PRU.LST)
Listing Energy Time Series (ETS.LST)
Metering Point Authorization Retrieve PRU (AGR.RTR.PRU)
Retrieve Energy Time Series UI (ETS.LST.GUI)
Retrieve Metering Point (MPT.RTR)
Retrieve Production Unit (PRU.RTR)
Retrieve Settlement Run Details (SMR.RTR.DTL)
Retrieve Timeseries (ETS.RTR)
Retrieve time series by TS type. (STS.TTS)
Search Accounting Points (ACP.FND)
Search Settlement (STS.LST)
Search Settlement Runs (SMR.LST)
Search TimeSeries (STS.LST_Results)
View Settlement Run (SMR.RTR)
Pls, identify the required set of system functions for the new role and include it in the standard roles (when 
tested and approved)

MP: Add Dormant Users report to Market party Admin roles
Dormant user report in GUI is now only accessible for MOP. 
Market party admins, would benefit from the report and it would make it easier for them 
to identify and manage Dormant users and through this make Datahub more secure.
Add system function RPT-SEC-DMT to roles Security report and authorize these for 
DSO_Admin, DDQ_Admin and THP_admin

Preliminary investigation
Consumers Customer Identification (personal identification) is to allow also others 
divider signs than - / A
The Finnish government is renewing the personal identifications to ensure that ID's do not run out. In the 
beginning of 2023, new customer identifications can also contain other signs than -/A as the divider. 
This change is to remove the validation that the personal identification can contain only -/A. It is possible to 
also change the validation to accept the new dividers (once they are defined by the regulator). 
The divider is not to impact the check-digit calculation.

1 The new dividers can be issued both to 
newborn children but also the 
immigrants getting a Finnish personal 
identification, which is why the change 
needs to be in affect from the beginning 
of year 2023.
