preliminary 2.2 
2.2 version changes to functionality: 
• 
Added a new reason code 'Termination of the seller's activity' (AN05) for the contract 
for deciding. The seller can use the code when announcing the decision himself DH-
at the 331 event. If the operator uses the mass event for its operations 
for closing/future sales contracts of the closing seller 
to cancel sales contracts, the distribution system operator is notified 
terminations with DH-331-2 messages and cancellations with DH-341-2 messages. 
Termination messages (DH-331-2) use a new reason code 
AN05 and reason code AR02 in the cancellation messages ('Seller 
canceled the contract'). (Chapter 3.2.4) Development proposal #141 
• 
Cancellation of the customer's online contract outside the balance window will not be refunded 
agreement prior to entry into force (chapter 3.2.5.2). Development Proposal #69 
• 
If the place of use is part of the netting or energy community calculations 
under construction, the calculation does not expect measurement data for the respective usage location, but 
the calculation is performed on the measurement data of other places of use that belong to it 
by. Change regarding netting calculation in version 2.1, 
regarding the energy community calculation in version 2.2. (Chapters 3.3.7 and 3.3.8) 
Development Proposal #202 
6/7/2023 
2.1 
2.1 version changes to functionality: 
• 
Termination and cancellation of the sales contract will be notified 
to the distribution system operator also when the network contract corresponding to the sales contract 
is unconfirmed, but these do not form a process chain (Chapter 3.15). 
Development proposal #41. 
• 
The authorization cannot be notified to the distribution system operator (chapters 3.9 and 3.9.1). 
Development proposal #65. 
• 
In reasoning about the need for a new network contract, an 'electricity supply contract'-
based on the information, the existing online agreement is also taken into account (chap 
3.2.2.1). Development proposal #144. 
• 
It is also possible to update the structural information of the product 
tax rate information of the product component (chapter 3.7.3). Development proposal #9, implemented 
already to version 2.0. 
Other updates: 
• 
Updated instructions on the recommended accuracy of measurement data (chapter 3.3.1). 
Development Proposal #64. 
• 
Added a rule missing from the description, according to which the energy community 
the distribution share of an individual member's place of use cannot be 100% (chapter 3.1.4).

Introduction 
1.1 
To the reader 
During 2014, Fingrid carried out a survey related to the electricity retail market 
about the future solution of information exchange. The report ended up recommending the establishment of a data hub 
To Finland. The Ministry of Labor and the Economy processed the report during the spring and on April 8, 2015 
in a letter, the ministry asked Fingrid to initiate an investigationthe implementation of the centralised 
data exchange solution described in the document. 
Datahub's business processes and its technical interface description have been defined in close cooperation with the 
industry in autumn 2015. The description of the processes has been supported by working groups appointed by the Finnish Energy Industries 
composed of representatives of the industry. The document, Business processes of the electricity retail market in Datahub, was submitted to the entire industry for comment and, based on the review of the comments, the first official version of the document was published on 
March 21, 2016. 
Close cooperation with the industry has been a basic requirement for the success of the definition work and a 
cost-effective approach. The members of the working groups have also served as an important 
link between the process work and the industry, bringing a broad view and 
expertise of the industry to the work. 
As the Datahub project progresses, a process working group composed of representatives of vendors and distribution network operators will support the project. The task of the process working group is to support the datahub project in handling the needs for and proposals for changes to the datahub 
business processes and data exchange definition documents efficiently, fairly and taking into account any potential 
multiple impacts on the sector. You can read more about the working group's activities on the datahub 
service portal, where all the project working groups are described. 
1.2 
Legislation concerning the operation of Datahub 
In accordance with the current Electricity Market Act, the task of the transmission system operator with system responsibility, i.e. 
Fingrid Oyj, is to develop the information exchange required for electricity trading and balance settlement in its area of ​​responsibility in cooperation with electricity companies. 
In addition to the above, Fingrid Oyj is responsible for the centralized organization of the information exchange and management required for the electricity trading 
market processes in the distribution networks, as well as for balance settlement in the distribution networks in its area of ​​responsibility. The centralised information exchange services for electricity trading 
(Datahub services described in section 1.2.1) are clearly listed and defined in the Electricity Market Act. 
The operational activities of the centralised information exchange services for electricity trading will be handled by Fingrid 
Oyj's wholly owned subsidiary Fingrid Datahub Oy. 
In order to make the interpretation of the law and its connection to the defined business processes clearer, the 
Datahub services, responsibilities and obligations of the various parties defined by the law, as well as the

who is obliged to use Datahub's services is also described in the following chapters of this document. 
1.2.1 
Datahub services 
The Electricity Market Act defines Datahub's tasks, i.e. the services it provides. The services in question 
refer to the business processes described in this document. 
Datahub services defined in the law are: 
1. maintenance of customer data and electricity consumption point data of retailers and distribution system operators; 
2. organisation of the exchange of information required by customer contract processes in retail sales and electricity distribution; 
3. organising the exchange of measurement data that forms the basis for billing and balance settlement; 
4. organising the exchange of data on electricity supplies and electricity distribution disconnection and connection processes; 
5. organising the maintenance of the distribution system operator's product and invoice line data and the possibility of maintaining the retailer's product and invoice line data; 
6. transmitting the retailer's and the distribution system operator's party information; 
7. access by the retailer's and the distribution system operator's customers to their own data held by the centralised electricity trade information exchange unit; 
8. organising the balance settlement of electricity trades in distribution networks and the exchange of data related to balance settlement; 
9. storing the data covered by the services referred to in paragraphs 1–8. 
1.2.2 
Data stored in Datahub and its disclosure 
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the storage of data stored in Datahub is one of 
Datahub's services. The definitions of business processes take into account the legal requirements related to data protection 
and therefore only the data required for business processes is stored in Datahub. Section 2.3 of this document describes in more detail how long data is stored and how the data is deleted after this storage period. 
Datahub will not disclose information other than on the basis of contractual rights or authorization given by the customer. Authorizations are described in section 3.8. 
More information about data protection in general is provided in section 1.5. 
1.2.3 
Parties using Datahub 
The Electricity Market Act clearly defines which electricity market parties are 
obliged to use Datahub services in the electricity retail marketnot in information exchange.  
A retailer and a distribution system operator who conducts electricity network operations in the distribution network must 
use datahub's services in the exchange of information on the electricity retail market. With a distribution network 
refers to an electrical network with a nominal voltage lower than 110 kilovolts (the nominal voltage is 
specified in the electricity network permit). Distribution system operator means a system operator that has

a distribution network or a high-voltage distribution network under its control and which carries out licensed activities 
electricity network activity in that network. The subject of the obligation would thus be distribution system operators, 
who have been granted an electricity grid license for electricity grid operations in a distribution network or in a closed one 
in the distribution network (nominal voltage lower than 110 kV). What these networks have in common is that they have 
places of use of the distribution network, with which it is necessary to organize related electricity market processes 
in accordance with uniform procedures. 
On the other hand, the obligation to use datahub's services does not apply to the distribution network operators who operate 
high-voltage distribution network or similar closed distribution network, i.e. these distribution system operators 
are not covered by datahub's services. Neither do the holders of these measuring areas who do not have 
electricity network license (e.g. industrial networks and production networks in the balance sheet) are not datahub's 
within the scope of the service. 
1.2.4 
Responsibilities and obligations of the parties 
The Electricity Market Act describes both datahub and the parties using datahub's services 
responsibilities and obligations.  
As explained in the previous paragraph, a retailer and a distribution system operator who engages 
electricity network operations in the distribution network, you must use the data hub's services for electricity 
in the exchange of information in the retail market. Essential from the point of view of datahub's business processes 
is that the parties are also responsible for the correctness of the information they provide to datahub and 
for correcting any errors without delay. Datahub does not make the information to be delivered 
checks for correctness, but checks that the information to be submitted contains everything 
mandatory information for the process and that the information to be submitted is in the correct format. 
The parties must also ensure that their information systems and those used for data transfer 
their systems are compatible with datahub.  
Datahub's responsibility is to organize the previously mentioned services and related retailers and 
storage of data provided by distribution system operators and services provided by the data hub 
that is, organizing the information exchange of the business processes described in this document. Part 
with the use of the data hub, the responsibilities of the distribution network operators are transferred to the scope of the data hub's responsibilities, such as 
for example, making a distribution system operator's balance sheet. 
One of the responsibilities transferred from the distribution system operator to the data hub is the reporting of electricity consumption data 
for the end user of electricity. Datahub will offer customers the opportunity to view their own 
their information in the customer portal implemented for this purpose. This has been explained in more detail 
in chapter 3.12. 
1.2.5 
Regulations supporting the law 
The new Electricity Market Act will be supported by electricity market regulations, which are the Government's 
regulation (VNA) on the investigation and measurement of electricity supplies, which details the parties 
duties and obligations regarding electricity supplies and balance sheet settlement. Both Work and

Decree of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Trade (TEMa) on the settlement of electricity trade and deliveries 
on the exchange of information, where the notification procedure for electricity supplies is explained in more detail.   
The estimated schedule for updating these regulations is during 2020.  
1.3 
Development in retail market data exchange datahub 
with 
The most important improvements and changes to the current one offered by datahub are presented below 
for information exchange. 
Centralized synchronous data exchange 
With Datahub, from party to party based on data transmission operators 
from information exchange to centralized information exchange. In the future, all information will be reported to datahub, 
where the information is processed and forwarded to other actors entitled to the information. The most significant difference 
the current practice is that all information exchange goes through one point, where everything 
the improvements described in this chapter to the current operation can be made possiblea. 
One of the most significant developments brought about by the data hub is the transition from the current main 
from batch-based asynchronous data exchange to synchronous data exchange. 
In practice, this means that datahub responds to the party's notifications immediately. In the future 
for example, after notifying the sales contract, the seller does not have to wait for the distribution system operator 
confirmation, but information about the acceptance or rejection of the contract is returned to the seller 
in real time directly from the data hub. This feature together with carefully designed processes 
with will reduce the need for clarification between the parties. Possible problems with new ones 
contracts can be processed with the customer immediately during the same customer contact. 
Unified customers for online and sales contracts 
Nowadays, customers of online and sales contracts often differ from each other. Online contract can 
for example, to be owned by the husband and the sales contract may be shared by the couple. However, there is in the field 
had a strong common vision that these contracts should have the same customers and different ones 
to avoid problem situations. 
In practice, achieving this goal requires uniform contractual practices. In the future 
the distribution system operator receives a notification from the data hub about the sales contract concluded for the point of use and 
of the customers connected here. If necessary, Datahub creates a network contract for the place of use 
for customers corresponding to the sales contract to be confirmed by the distribution system operator in the data hub. Bridge 
the operating method ensures that the online and sales contracts will always be the same in the future 
to customers.  
The method of operation is the valid procedure guidelines of the current Energiateollisuus ry 
according to, i.e. the customer should always be directed to contact the seller in the first place. This 
the operating method also requires that new contracts must always be drawn up for those with legal capacity 
to customers. The distribution system operator cannot be required to act contrary to this principle. For new ones

Y-IDs of companies and personal IDs of consumer customers must always be indicated on contracts. 
An exception is allowed only in situations where the person does not have a Finnish personal identification number. 
Transfer of the distribution system operator's balance sheet to the data hub 
With the introduction of Datahub, currently the distribution system operator's calculations and balance sheet 
the reported sum deliveries per seller and the distribution system operator's losses are calculated in the data hub. 
Datahub also calculates vendor-specific balance error corrections and informs the distribution network operator 
vendor-specific balance sheet errors for invoicing vendors. With Datahub, the distribution network operator does not 
need to perform the calculations described above in their own system and do not maintain information 
of the sellers of the place of use for balance settlement calculations. Datahub will deliver the necessary 
balance sheet information for eSett and for the retail market, the market parties are in contact 
Instead of eSett's system, to datahub in matters related to the balance sheet of the distribution network. 
Sellers and distribution system operators can monitor their own through the interface provided by datahub 
balance settlement information, including amount delivery information and balance error information. Datahub too 
reports to the distribution system operators about places of use without vendors, so that the distribution system operator knows 
to cut off the electricity in places of use without vendors. 
Intensification of supervision 
In the current exchange of information, there are situations where the market parties do not work together 
in accordance with the agreed game rules. Monitoring tools will be created in Datahub, with the help of which 
the activities of operators can be monitored. The purpose of monitoring is to collect material with which possible 
abuses and deviations from the common rules of the game can be pointed out and wronged 
with this, the activity can be intervened. 
Information exchange of product and billing information 
Current message traffic does not exchange product or billing information related to the place of use. Datahub 
enables the maintenance and exchange of information on sales and transfer products. With this 
the market participants can, if they wish, take into account the other party, i.e. the seller or 
the distribution system operator, the product chosen for the place of use in its own product selection, and thus offer 
uniform products for the customer both in terms of transmission and electricity sales. 
Datahub also enables the transmission of invoice lines. Market participants can report if they wish 
invoice lines to the data hub, from where they are delivered to the seller of the point of use, the distribution system operator or 
to an authorized 3rd party in the counter lines. This makes it easier for different people 
utilization of invoicing service providers in business and one online service and 
including energy salesrather than offering the invoice to the customer. 
Utilization of service providers 
Datahub will make it easier for market parties to utilize various service providers 
in business. Standardized interfaces and a centralized data exchange solution reduce 
data exchange costs, when service providers, i.e. so-called 3rd parties, do not have to 
organizes data transfer connections with each market party separately.

Comprehensive and high-quality information content 
In connection with defining the Datahub processes, all market participants were surveyed 
information needed in business, which should be exchanged between sellers, distribution system operators and 3rd parties 
between. This means an expansion of the information content to be exchanged compared to the current information exchange. 
In the information on the place of use, for example, information about the place of use will be available in the future 
about the possibility of remote connection. 
In Datahub, the quality of information will also be better than at present. Datahub has validations and 
control, which can be used to prevent the storage and transmission of incomplete and technically incorrect information. 
The most significant improvements concern the use of customers' unique identifiers (personal identification numbers and Y-
identifiers) maintenance, measurement data and address data.  
Measurement data based on continuous measurement 
In Finland, there has been a transition to comprehensive hourly measurement and the remaining traditional so-called 
the number of reading measurements is constantly decreasing. Datahub's functionalities are defined in such a way that 
the special treatment of the reading measurements is taken into account only in the most necessary parts.  
With Datahub, transmission of cumulative readings is not supported in data exchange. The distribution system operator 
should be made up of reading measurements and unmeasured items Specific to the place of use 
hourly time series for balance settlement and information transmission. It should be noted that the datahub 
with the implementation, a separate smoothing calculation of the measured reading data will not be performed.  
Datahub will also support a 15-minute balance settlement cycle that is more frequent than an hour. 
Supporting statutory reporting 
Comprehensive information related to the place of use, the customer and contracts is brought to Datahub. This 
the information content can be used in creating statutory reports for operators. 
Services for 3rd parties 
Datahub facilitates the business of various service providers. Customer, seller or 
authorized by the distribution system operator, a third party has the opportunity to use the 
and customer-specific information including measurement data from one place. Ad hoc 
3. the parties must enter into an agreement with datahub, which obligates the party to the common 
to comply with the rules of the game. 
A more customer-oriented service 
All the development described above aims to make business more efficient and more customer-oriented 
to the service. Datahub's contract processes reduce error and problem situations that arise 
as a better service for the customer. The services described above for 3rd parties will also be added 
offering various customer services. The principle is that the data hub works as a joint industry 
as a back-end system that enables companies in the industry to offer their customers 
better customer service.

Business development 
Datahub will also play a significant role in the development of various business operations. In public 
in the discussion, different visions of future electricity are brought up more and more often 
from the retail market. The key themes in this discussion are consumer demand elasticity, 
electric car charging and various energy efficiency and management services. Datahub is coming 
to enable and contribute to various new services and what they need 
development of information exchange. 
1.4 
Business in a datahub environment 
The parties work in the data hub with different roles. The roles are divided at the top level to reflect that 
role model, which is used in EDIEL-based information exchange. With the introduction of Datahub 
these roles used in the current data exchange will be shared in the system 
to a more precise process level, in accordance with the information exchange processes, based on the ebIX role model. 
ebIX is a European cooperation platform for the development of information exchange in the energy industry. This one 
with the role model, the aim is to create a common terminology and through this to facilitate e.g. 
systems development. The role model in questionia has also been used in the data hubs of other Nordic countries
in projects, so bringing it to the Finnish retail market also supports the Nordic countries 
harmonization of the electricity market.  
The ebIX role model identifies all the roles that can be used in the electricity market in Europe. 
The model covers both wholesale and retail markets, but Datahub does not have one 
appropriate to implement all ebIX roles, but only where applicable 
to support defined market processes. The roles according to the ebIX model are by nature 
logical ones, such as the balance sheet manager. More detailed descriptions of the ebIX role model can be found at ebIX 
from the website https://www.ebix.org/artikel/role_model.  
A more detailed breakdown of the roles of the parties in the data hub allows, for example, access rights 
according to a specific set of needs. Rights can be linked to a specific role model 
access to information or rights to perform certain processes or events. 
Current developments seem to change the operation of market participants in a direction where 
market participants widely use their partner networks and their own service providers 
to carry out its activities. Datahub will support this trend by enabling it 
the use of more precise roles and thereby facilitate the assignments of market participants 
giving to service providers for a certain pre-defined task.  For example 
the distribution network operator can give the measurement information to the company providing the commissioned measurement services 
to datahub for delivery. In this case, the assignment is given to a specific service provider 
for the role according to which access rights, rights to send the event and 
rights to datahub information needed in the event.  
In the following chapters, it is summarized by role how datahub will change operators 
daily business.

1.4.1 
Sellers 
The main tasks of salespeople in the data hub are the initiation of contract processes and customer information 
maintenance. Contract processes include notification of new contracts, customer moves and 
in connection with changes of the seller, changes to contracts during delivery and contracts 
terminations. 
Datahub enables an even more customer-oriented and customer-friendly service for sellers. Seller 
get the necessary amount of information about the basic information of the location of use to enter into a sales contract. 
In addition, the seller can, with the authorization given by the customer, check the valid place of use, 
web product1-, and measurement information before the actual contract is concluded, if applicable 
necessary. If necessary, the seller can, before announcing the contract, by the customer 
with the authorization also checks whether the customer has a valid license preventing the conclusion of the contract 
a sales contract for a place of use that is temporary or contains unusual terms of termination. The seller does not 
however, with an authorization, you can get more detailed information about a place of use for which the customer has 
there is no contract yet. This means, for example, the place of use where the customer is moving. 
The seller can also check the connection status of the point of use and inform about possible connection fees 
for the customer in quick moving situations. A more real-time exchange of information will reduce the variety 
problems and their investigation, which improves the customer's service experience.  
Nowadays, challenges are also created by the fact that the seller must determine whether it is a move or the seller 
exchange. Notifications sent with the wrong reason code always require manual processing. In the future 
the seller does not need to do this reasoning, because datahub always has information about the place of use 
about the customer's situation and datahub returns a notice to the seller of the reason for the creation of the contract 
in the receipt. 
In the ebIX role model, the seller has no other role than Balance Supplier, i.e. the Seller who is responsible 
about the electricity contract with the customer and the sale of electricity within the contract or, if applicable 
is from the small production location, the purchase of electricity.   
1.4.2 
Distribution system operators 
In Datahub, the distribution network operator's main tasks are to maintain the usage location, network contract and 
product information of online contracts and maintain the structural information needed for the balance sheet, 
such as border points and production units (Production Unit). In addition to the above, the distribution system operator must 
reports the measurement data daily to the data hub, from where it is forwarded to the parties entitled to the information. 
Although measurement data statuses and their use are also validated in the data hub, there is measurement data 
correctness is still the responsibility of the distribution system operator. Therefore, the distribution system operator must perform its own 
validation of measurement data in the future. 
With the change brought by Datahub, the distribution network managertija can waive its own balance sheet settlement, balance sheet error
/for their compensation and loss calculations. The invoicing of balance errors is still carried out by the distribution system operator 
by, even if the calculation is performed in the data hub. With the introduction of Datahub

the importance of location-specific vendor information for the distribution system operator decreases, but does not disappear 
wholly. In the future, there will be situations where the distribution system operator must be contacted directly 
to the seller of the place of use, although less than today. The distribution system operator still receives the information 
of new sales contracts that have been implemented and the seller of the place of use of his own online contract 
for maintenance and switching situations. With the improved exchange of information, various 
clarifying problem situations with customers and sellers will also decrease 
for the distribution system operator. 
The transmission of measurement data takes place via the data hub, in which case the distribution network operator does not have to agree 
with all parties separately on the transfer of information. This applies especially to third parties 
measurement data to be transmitted and management of the authorizations received from the customer. In chapter 3.11.  
The described customer service portal offered to datahub's customers will cover the distribution system operator 
obligation to report measurement data to customers according to current legislation.  
In its role, the distribution system operator is responsible for more information and thus operates in more ebIX
in the role of a model. In the role of Grid Operator, the distribution system operator is responsible for the measurement area 
of data and in the role Metered Data Responsible corresponds to the place of use 
measurement data. In the role of person responsible for measurement data, measurement data is also delivered to the data hub. 
The distribution network operator acts in the role of Grid Access Provider, i.e. Network Service Provider, when it takes care of it 
of electricity network contracts with the customer and in this role is responsible for the information on the place of use.  
If it wishes, the distribution system operator can use a service provider to handle the different 
processes, for example delivery of measurement data, which is managed in the role Measurement data 
equivalent. In this case, the service provider can deliver the measurement data to the data hub of the distribution system operator 
on behalf of. However, the distribution system operator remains responsible for the information provided.  
1.4.3 
Customers 
From the customers' point of view, the datahub will mainly be in the electricity retail market 
the background system used by the parties, the use of which is not visible to the customer when he deals with electricity 
with the seller or distribution network operator. Datahub and renewed market processes 
the implementation is seen by customers as better and faster customer service 
during the processing times of contractual transactions. Datahub enables the customer to be more active than at present 
role as a consumer and also a producer of electricity. In particular, easier access to information by 3rd parties 
based on the customer's authorizations, will increase the various services offered to customers 
quantity. Datahub enables a more comprehensive coverage of the customer's own electricity usage 
providing services and an overall view to the customer, even in situations where the customer has multiple 
the places of use are sold by different sellers or in the measurement area of ​​different distribution system operators. 
The customer will have the opportunity to check their own data stored in the data hub for them 
through a targeted customer portal. The customer's login to the service will be implemented 
Through the national Suomi,fi service maintained by the Population Register Center. Powered by Datahub 
the service will cover the current distribution system operator's statutory reporting obligation to its own 
to their customers. From the service in question, the customer can add and remove authorizations given to the parties 
to their own information. In accordance with the Electricity Market Act and the valid data protection regulation, consumer

for customers, authorizations are maintained only through datahub's customer portal, 
maintained by the customer himself.  The authorization given by the customer will be 
location-specific and temporary. To ensure the customer's interest, for the time being 
valid authorizations are not allowed and the authorization can be valid for a maximum of two years 
at a time. 
 
The ebIX role model also has its own role for the end customer, Party Connected to Grid, i.e. Customer.  
1.4.4 
3. Parties 
Previously describedin accordance with datahub will facilitate the business of 3rd parties with information 
due to better availability. Datahub will require a service contract from 3rd parties 
signing. The service contract specifies what kind of service the party can access data for 
use and other conditions for using the service. The 3rd party always acts as authorized by the customer or the seller 
or commissioned by the distribution system operator. Authorizations are described in more detail in this document 
in chapter 3.9.  
In general, the 3rd party can be any party registered in datahub with a contract 
with the datahub operator. A seller or 
a distribution network operator who does not have the right to the customer's data within the scope of the contract. 
As mentioned earlier, the distribution system operator can give an order for the delivery of measurement data 
datahub to a 3rd party, in which case the service provider acts as a collector of measurement data. 3rd party 
can also provide a service directly to the customer, in which case it acts as an Energy Service Company, i.e 
Energy service provider. In such a role, the 3rd party must be authorized by the customer 
to the customer's information. The 3rd party can also act in the role of Billing Agent, which is loosely translated 
A process service provider, in which case it works either on behalf of the seller or the distribution system operator. 
In this case, the seller or the distribution network operator can forward, for example, invoice line data to a 3rd party who handles it 
customer billing for this. The term Process service provider describes better here 
the party acting in the role, because this can provide other services to the parties than 
billing service.  
1.4.5 
Datahub operator 
With the data hub, a new party is born in the electricity retail market. Datahub operator 
the primary task is to maintain the datahub system and provide technical support for operators 
for main users. Other tasks include, for example, general guidance related to the industry's data hub, 
Supervision of compliance with the terms of Datahub's service contracts and the agreed game rules, various 
investigation of error situations requested by market parties and the development of the data hub and information exchange 
in close cooperation with the industry. 
In the ebIX model, the data hub operator does not have a direct role in data exchange. 
When the balance settlement of the distribution network moves to the data hub, the role related to the balance settlement ebIX-
in the Metered Data Aggregator model to be handled by the datahub.

Data protection 
An essential part of the management of customer and location data is the datahub's registered users 
data protection, which means the protection of people's private lives. Datahub and market processes 
the design is made from the premise that all information that can be connected to the customer is 
personal information. Such information is personal information regardless of whether this information can be linked 
to a single person in the data hub. For example, the address of the place of use is independent of personal information 
whether the person's name or social security number is stored in the datahub. Place of use for personal information 
what makes an address is that the customer's address is generally relatively easy to find out. This 
also applies to situations where the customer does not live at the specific address of the place of use. 
The market processes are designed in such a way that the data hub is only saved in market processes 
the necessary information and the parties can apply for or can be forwarded information from the datahub only to them 
according to predetermined rights. These rights depend on the party's role, 
about the contractual situation and existing authorizations.

Contents of this document 
Chapter 2 describes the requirements of the market processes for the data hub's internal data model, as well as 
descriptions of the main data groups. The chapter also describes the rights of each datahub party 
to information.  
Chapter 3 describes the business processes and operating models of the electricity retail market, which 
datahub supports. This description contains the principles and rules for how parties apply and report 
information to the data hub, and how information is transmitted to other parties as part of market processes. Description 
contains descriptions of overall processes from the business perspective of the parties. More specific 
event-specific descriptions are described in the Datahub events document, which has been published 
also in datahub's service portal.

Reading instructions for UML descriptions 
In this document, flowcharts (in UML 
activity diagram). The costs of market processes are presented as sequence diagrams and 
the data contents of the notifications and other descriptions of the data models are described with class diagrams. 
When interpreting the document, remember that although the UML notation is largely standardized, this is not 
however, do not mean that UML models are completely free of interpretation. Large entities 
can always be modeled from different perspectives and UML is generally used for many different ones 
for uses (e.g. software development vs. business processes) that require different 
interpretation. Especially a single diagram can at best only show a part of the background 
of the whole. There are also a lot of alternative ways of presenting something and even forced interpretation 
always reserve ice. In this document, no attempt has been made to be as orthodox as possible 
From the point of view of UML's technical specification, but to create as illustrative and easy as possible 
comprehensible presentations.  
To create the diagrams and modeling of the electricity retail market in this document, there is 
used MagicDraw software (No Magic, Inc.), which is the same as NordREG 
the software used in the harmonization project and ebIX. Below is a brief introduction to UML diagrams 
for interpretation. More UML information can be found on the Internet, especially in English. This document 
for example, Wikipedia2 and http://www.uml-diagrams.org -
website. More information and a link to the official UML documentation can also be found 
From the UML website of the Object Management Group, which manages the development of UML3.

General marking methods 
• 
The text written inside the << >> characters is the so-called a stereotype that is meant to be refined

TABLE 111 UML CONNECTION TYPES USED IN THIS DOCUMENT 
Connection type 
Definition 
 
Generalization:the object at the tip is a generalization of the source at the other end. 

Association: a connection between objects that has a counterpart in reality. 
A possible arrow at the end of the line indicates in this document in which 
direction the connection name (e.g. "contains") is read. 

Strong composition: the entity at the unchecked end is essentially 
part of the entity at the checked end. For example, customer data is an integral part of a 
contract. 

Dependency: The source is somehow dependent on the object. This 
type of connection is always used in this document with a qualifying text or 
stereotype. 
1.8.2 
Class diagrams 
Class diagrams consist of so-called entities, the relationships between them, and the 
data contained in the entities. An entity represents a specific physical or logical (data) entity. Examples of 
entities are a point of use and a sales contract. The image below shows an example of 
entities that occur in message traffic. 
• 
The entity names are written in bold at the top of the box describing the entity. 
• 
Below the line below the name are the entity attributes, or data fields. The square brackets 
following the attributes define the multiplicity of the attribute, or information about how 
many values ​​the data field can or should contain. For example, [0..1] means that the field is 
optional (or only mandatory in certain situations) and [1] means that the value is mandatory. 
If there can be an unspecified number of values, the * character is used for this purpose. 
A similar notation is also used to describe connections between entities. As shown in the 
image below, for example, there may not be a sales contract for a point of use. 
This is indicated by writing 0..1 at the end of the sales contract of the connection between these two entities. If no value is written separately for 
diversity at the end of the connection, the diversity is 1 by default.

Sequence diagrams 
Sequence diagrams show the flow of a process and in particular the exchange of information between actors. 
The different roles of the process are placed on the horizontal axis and time is shown on the vertical axis. In this document, 
each exchange of information between roles is numbered. As a rule, messages occur in numerical order over time. However, this can be deviated from by using subsequences. The alt, par, opt and loop subsequences used in this 
document are explained below. 
• 
in the graphs, the time limits within {} brackets are days, unless otherwise specified in the graph; 
• 
in the {} brackets, the notation is {earliest..latest} 
NOTE! it is also possible that only one of these time limits is specified. If 
no earliest or latest limit is specified, there is no corresponding binding time limit; 
• 
in the time limits, negative numbers mean the time before the start of delivery and the entry into force of the 
contract amendment or other change, and positive numbers mean the time 
after these.

Alternative costs 

FIGURE 333 EXAMPLE DIAGRAM OF ALTERNATIVE COST IN A SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 
In a sequence diagram, the alternative costs of a process are described with the alt (alternative) subsequence. 
The actual flow depends on predefined conditions. In the example above, if the condition written inside the brackets 
is met, party 1 sends message 1 to party 2. Otherwise, party 2 sends message 2 to party 1. Note that there can be more than one message on both sides of the dotted line.

The optional flow of a process is described by the opt (option) subsequence. In the example above, 
party 1 always sends message 1 to party 2, but party 2 only sends message 2 if [condition] 
is met. 
Parallel flow 

FIGURE 555 EXAMPLE DIAGRAM OF PARALLEL FLOW IN A SEQUENCE DIAGRAM 
The par subsequence describes flows that are executed in parallel. For exampleIn the case of erki, message 1 and 2 
can be sent in parallel or in either order. However, this does not mean that 
neither of the messages can be left unsent. 
Loop 
A loop subsequence is repeated as many times as a certain condition written in square brackets 
is valid. An example of a loop is shown in the figure below.

Datahub's data model and the parties' rights to 
information 
2.1 
Description of the conceptual model 
This section describes Datahub's internal data model at a conceptual level, i.e. the structure in which 
the data submitted by the parties to Datahub and generated by Datahub is stored. The data model does not describe 
the datahub's physical database, and is not a complete description of the future Datahub data model, but 
it describes the most important data sets for market processes and their relationships to each other. 
The attributes of the main data groups are listed in the data model images attached to Chapter 3 of this document. 
A more detailed definition of each attribute can be found in a separately published Excel data table (so-called 
data standard). When reading the images, it should be noted that information marked as optional in the image may be mandatory depending on other information. For example, the fuse size of the point of use is 
mandatory if the electrical power of the point of use has not been reported. 
The contents of the information sent by the parties to Datahub in processes and transmitted by Datahub to the parties in processes are described in the event-specific class diagrams in sections 4-12 of the Datahub Events document.

Data retention period 
Information is stored in the data hub according to the needs of the parties' processes. Information cannot 
however, stored in the datahub forever. Storage time of measurement data in the operational data hub 
there are six years in the database, and this time also guides other processes 
storage of redundant data. When the customer's contract ends, the customer and 
contract information from datahub's operational database after the same six-year period, 
when the last measurement data related to the customer is deleted. Contract information is calculated 
in addition to the actual contract information, also invoice line information related to the contract to be deleted and 
customer data includes all data directly connected to the customer, such as the customer's authorization data. Also 
places of use in disabled status are deleted if there is not a single contract associated with them. 
The picture below shows the process by which datahub will delete the history data above 
according to the described procedure.

User interface of the parties 
Datahub offers a browser-based user interface for use by all market participants, where 
the parties can manage their own party information, assignments between the parties and 
settings related to the use of datahub's message interface. In the user interface, the parties can also 
view all data hub data related to market processes to which the party has access 
in accordance with paragraph 2.2, the right.  
The user interface of Datahub's parties has two different types of user groups. Another group of users 
consists of parties that use in the exchange of information related to market processes 
as a rule, a message interface from their own system. As a rule, these users do not 
maintain the information related to market processes in the user interface for processingis specified 
processing processes based on the message interface. This information needs to be updated 
through the message interface, so that the data is consistent between the operators' systems and the data hub 
can be verified. In this case, market processes are mainly managed through the user interface 
e.g. structural information related to the balance sheet and information for which it has not been deemed necessary 
determine market messages, as well as some less common market processes such as 
previous seller's approval for a change of seller in retroactive error correction situations. These 
special market processes are described separately in chapter 3. As a rule, such an interface 
it is possible for the main user of the using party to give one to his own system user 
user role with which these processes can be maintained directly in the datahub user interface. 
However, the party must then ensure that the same information reported to the data hub can be saved 
to the party's own system in such a way that no new notification is sent to datahub. I.e 
the party is then responsible for the compatibility of data between the data hub and the party's own system 
by himself.  
Another group of users using the user interface consists of market participants who do not either 
due to low process execution times or some other reason, it is not profitable to build 
message interface for information exchange of market processes. These market participants are offered 
possibility to manually perform all data processing of market processes 
in the user interface. The same applies to market processes performed via the user interface

rules and checks of the correctness of data than the actual ones carried out through interfaces 
message processes. It should be noted, however, that this possibility is not suitable for large 
for processing data volumes. Because of this, there is no notification of measurement data or calculation line data 
possible through the party's user interface. Measurement, balance sheet and 
invoice line information is also not forwarded to the party's user interface separately in message form. 
The party using the user interface to perform market processes can order these if they wish 
transmission of information to himself from the System via the message interface. 
Search events can be used both via the message interface and directly from the user interface. 
For example, measurement data can be retrieved both via the interface and the user interface. 
The measurement data retrieved from the user interface is returned as a control report in .csv format.  
The management of the parties' users is based on a model where the parties have one or more main users, 
who can grant access rights to other users of their own organization. Users can 
set the rights to both view and edit the data, or only view. Datahub 
also enables access rights to be defined in such a way that only certain users of the organization have them 
there is an opportunity to see personal data. User management instructions can be found in datahub 
from the service portal.  
Through the user interface of the parties, the parties can check the information between the parties 
assignments and maintains authorizations between the parties. Assignments and parties 
authorizations are described in chapter 3.9.2 of this document. 
Datahub offers the parties standard reports in the user interface by the parties themselves 
for review. Some of the reports correspond to what the operator needs in his own operations 
for all parties, but the parties see these reports as relevant to themselves 
information. The reports are produced using the Power-BI tool.

Information interface for market participants 
Data exchange through the data hub is handled as described in the Datahub transactions document 
with message traffic based on ebIX message specifications. The parties will have 
also use the user interface intended for them, which is described in chapter 2.4 of this document. 
In addition to these, datahub will also offer the parties a so-called data interface, which 
with the help of this, the parties can be more flexibly offered information that belongs to them directly without events 
related messages. The data interface is implemented as a REST/HTTP interface. The data interface makes it possible 
e.g. searching for data in the datahub directly for the market party's end customers 
to the online service provided. Data cannot be reported to datahub via the data interface. 
Market participants can decide themselves whether they want to use this interface in their own 
in its operation. If the parties need to search for a larger amount of data at once, for example 
to compare the information in the data hub with the information in their own system, comes to this purpose 
use control reports provided by datahub. These reports can be run on a schedule, e.g. 
at night without disturbing other daily activities. 
The data interface can also be used when an external registered party (3rd party or other 
market participant) develops and creates new services for which the customer can authorize their own 
to their information. 3rd party service can be e.g. an application with which the end user can see his own data 
regardless of all their places of use, in which network area they are located or who sells to them 
electricity.  
From the data interface, information can be queried for a single record (customer information/location) at a time. 
In other words, the data interface does not support the so-called mass searches, which could be used to search for information from many places of use 
at a time. The following data searches are implemented in the data interface: 
• 
Search for location information 
• 
Search for contract information for the place of use 
• 
Search for measurement data of the place of use 
• 
Search for authorization information for the place of use

Regarding party information, the information of all parties can be searched for at once. 
When using the information interface, the parties' rights to information are taken into account with the same rules as 
in the message interface. The party gets thisonly access the information to which the party has the right either through an agreement or authorization. To ensure data protection, the customer ID with which the agreement has been made must always be entered in the search. A single customer ID is also sufficient if the agreement has more than one customer. 
Datahub's data interface has its own documentation published in the service portal's 
Interface descriptions. 
In addition to the data interface, datahub offers parties the opportunity to run .csv-format 
control reports on their own data for data quality checking purposes. Control reports can be run on all of the party's own data by data set, including customer, 
location of use, contract and authorization data. For example, a party can run a control report on all of its own customer data, in which case Datahub returns a report on all of the customers active at the time given for the report, to whom the party running the report has the right either under the agreement or authorization.

Description of market processes 
3.1 
DH-100 Management of customer, utility and energy community information 
Customer and utility information are the most important basic information exchanged between the parties, which are 
stored in the Datahub database. This chapter describes the principles of maintaining and searching for this and energy community information in Datahub. 
3.1.1 
DH-120 Maintenance of utility information 
The utility information stored in Datahub is presented in the following figure. 

FIGURE 999 CLASSIFICATION DIAGRAM OF UTILITY POINT DATA 
The information on the usage points and, more broadly, all metering points is owned by the distribution system operator. Therefore, the maintenance of the usage point data in Datahub is the responsibility of the distribution system operator.

The distribution system operator is responsible for creating usage points, updating data and 
notifying usage points as decommissioned. 
The usage point life cycle and possible states during it are described in the following figure. 

FIGURE 101010 STATUS DIAGRAM OF USAGE POINTS 
A usage point must be created in Datahub as soon as it has been established in the distribution system operator's system. 
Since the contract information is valid for whole days, in order to avoid conflicts, 
the usage point information is also valid for whole days. The usage point must be provided with the GSRN code based on the GS1 system, which identifies the data hub. 
The usage point may be located near the Finnish border but in the area of ​​the distribution system operator in Datahub, and in this case the address of the usage point may be outside Finland. Therefore, the 
use point information must includecountry information. 
A usage location can be created in the data hub already during the construction phase, when its status becomes "under construction". 
The purpose of this information is to inform the seller that the contract can be concluded and announced 
to the datahub, but delivery to the destination cannot be started for the time being. Delivery is not possible 
for example, to start if the place of use is new and the meter has not yet been installed.

When the point of use is "metered", i.e. when it is possible to start delivery, the distribution system operator activates 
by updating its status to "connected" or "disconnected" depending on whether it is started at the same time 
delivery or not. Updating to "connected" and "disconnected" state is done by switching and 
using disconnect events. Updating to "Removed from the system" status takes place 
with the deletion event of the place of use. Other status changes will be announced at the place of use 
with an update event.  
The distribution system operator can temporarily passivate the access point by changing its status to "under construction". 
This is how it works, e.g. in renovation sites, when it is temporarily not possible to start delivery to the place of use. 
The current sales contract is not automatically terminated when the place of use is changed to this one 
space, but the seller must agree on the matter with the customer if necessary. 
When delivery to the point of use can be started normally, its status in the data hub is "connected" or 
"truncated". Contracts and delivery can be made for the places of use in these premises 
start immediately ("switched on") or as soon as the point of use can be switched on ("switched off"). 
The distribution network operator sets the access point in the data hub to "disabled" when the access point 
taking it out of use is final, for example, when the distribution system operator terminates the subscription. 
The distribution system operator must ensure that the termination of the usage site contracts is notified 
to the datahub before notification of the removal of the place of use. When the place of use has been declared deleted 
of use, contracts can no longer be concluded for the place of use and its status can no longer be changed 
back e.g. 'switched on'. 
Usage slots created incorrectly in the data hub must be deleted from the data hub. To remove the place of use 
own deletion event is used. You can no longer use an incorrectly declared user ID 
reuse when creating a new location. The usage location information remains deleted in the data hub 
from the system as an opportunity. A location of use that has been removed from the system is not visible to the distribution system operator 
in addition to other parties, for example when searching for a user ID. If there is for the place of use 
had time to make transactions that have not yet taken effect before the error was detected, will 
these events must be canceled first, after which the place of use must be set to the state "deactivated. 
 
Contracts can be made for the place of use as soon as its information can be found in the data hub. Provided 
a new sales contract is made for the place of use while it is still in the state "under construction", but delivery 
cannot be started on the marked start date of the contract, the start date of the sales contract and 
the actual Connection date will differ. In these situations, the distribution system operator 
in the data hub, the connection notification indicated automatically changes the on the connection day 
the effective dates of the valid sales and network agreement to correspond to the connection date. Seller 
receives a notification about the update of the usage location information and the connection and this notification 
based on this, the seller must update the effective date to the connection date in his own system. 
Datahub also updates the effective date of the network contract, so the network company also ensures, 
that the effective date of the network contract in your own system is the same as the connection date. 
Datahub does not notify the parties of a change in the date of the contracts. The parties 
in this situation, no announcement should be made regarding the update of the effective date 
nor to datahub. If the state of the place of use is changed, for example during repairs, will

the point of use first updates the "under construction" state to the "disconnected" state and only then connects, if 
no changes are wanted to the start dates of the contracts.   
The information about the time zone of the place of use in the basic information of the place of use gives the seller what he needs 
information when choosing the product of the sales contract for the customer. If the seller wants more detailed information 
from the place of use before the notification of the contract,The information can be retrieved with the customer's authorization. 
The processing of authorizations is described in more detail in section 3.9.1. 
The table below summarizes the states of the point of use during its life cycle and the 
meanings of the states.

In addition to the point of use status, the distribution system operator must update other information about its own points of use to the 
datahub, excluding the point of use identifier, which must never be updated. The update must be made 
as soon as the data changes in the distribution system operator's own system. Datahub stores 
historical data of the point of use, i.e. the creation or modification time is always stored for the point of use data, 
which is taken into account when searching for the data according to the rights of the parties. 
The point of use property "heating depends on electricity" partly affects whether the parties have the right to 
disconnect the electricity to the point of use in winter (Network Service Terms VPE 2019, section 9.1.4). 
The distribution system operator is responsible for maintaining the data in Datahub. However, Datahub does not validate disconnection requests or notifications on this basis. 
The current and future seller of the point of use and the third party also have the opportunity to notify of 
changes to the point of use data. However, the point of use data reported to Datahub by the seller or third party is not automatically updated to Datahub, but is forwarded to the distribution system operator, who 
makes the actual update. The distribution system operator must respond to the update request by sending an 
update of the access point information to Datahub, which includes either the information provided by the seller/third party 
(the distribution system operator accepts the update request), or the 
access point information in its own system (the distribution system operator rejects the update request). If the distribution system operator decides

if the information on the point of use has not been updated, the distribution system operator must also provide a reason why the information has not been updated. 
As part of the update of the point of use, the distribution system operator also updates the annual usage estimate information for the point of use. In general, the annual usage estimate should only be updated when a new contract is notified to the point of use. If only the annual usage estimate information is updated to Datahub, this must be reported to Datahub with its own reason information "Update of the annual usage estimate". In this case, only the reported annual usage estimate will be stored in Datahub during the update and not other information on the point of use. 
The process description for updating the point of use information is shown in the following figure. 

FIGURE 111111 PROCESS DESCRIPTION OF UPDATING POINT OF USE INFORMATION 
Consumption and production points of use may be located in the same physical location, but they are treated as separate 
points of use in the datahub. Consumption and production points of use are separated from each other

with the type information of the usage site. Therefore, for a small-scale production usage site, in addition to the type information, the word "Production" in the address of the usage site is not needed. In terms of the functionality of the contract processes, there is a need to maintain a more reliable way to link these consumption and production usage sites together in addition to the address. This linking is done through the maintenance processes of the parallel usage site information by informing the consumption/production usage site of the identifier of the production/consumption usage site with which the consumption/production usage site is physically located in the same location. The link between the connected 
points of use is bidirectional, i.e. each point of use has information about the other linked (parallel) point of use. With the link, the parallel points of use are included in the netting calculations if the calculation conditions are met, and information about their inclusion in the calculations is stored in the points of use. The netting of metering data for parallel points of use is described in section 3.3.7. 
The Finnish retail market is moving to hourlyfrom measurement to 15-minute measurement (arm measurement) 
From 1 January 2023. The transition is carried out flexibly so that the notification of hourly measurement data is 
possible during the transition period. The transition period is specified in the Government Decree on Electricity 
on delivery and measurement in the transition provision. Due to the transition period, distribution system operators 
must be controlled by the time step (hour or 15 
minutes) per measurement point. The time step of the measurement of the place of use is updated with a separate time
with a step update event. The time step of production units and limit points is updated 
with the datahub user interface. The update also applies to the reactive energy of the measurement point. Datahub does not update 
from the time step of the possible parallel usage location measurement automatically, but by the network company 
you should always update the information for each place of use separately. Often parallel places of use 
are measured with the same meter, in which case the time steps are also the same. Sellers have to 
however, it is good to note that a different time step may occur at parallel places of use, if 
the distribution system operator has changed the time step to only one of the parallel usage locations. Time-
the step can be updated retroactively, but only for the time the balance window is open (11 days). 
Retrospective updating is not possible, however, if values ​​have already been reported for the measurement point previously 
with a time step for the time after the effective time of the update. In the event of an error, the datahub
the operator can perform a retrospective update for a maximum of the open time of the balance window 
from the distribution system operator's service request. 
From the point of view of Datahub's operation, it does not matter whether it is a construction site, event or other 
processing of temporary places of use takes place in the distribution system operator's internal processes. 
Distribution system operators have different operating methods for handling temporary usage locations. Provided 
the distribution system operator always sets up a new one in its own system at the temporary point of use 
place of use, the new place of use is reported to datahub according to the normal creation process. 
If, on the other hand, the distribution network operator uses one usage location ID and only updates the usage location 
according to the address, where the temporary place of use is located at any time, the corresponding is indicated 
change of address to the datahub with the update event of the location of use. The distribution system operator must here 
in this case, ensure that the location of use is not reported to datahub as disabled for so long, 
when it will be used again.

FIGURE 121212 CLASS DIAGRAM OF CUSTOMER DATA 
The starting point for maintaining customer data in datahub is that a customer is created only once, and 
the customer's basic information is shared among all the market participants who have the customer 
contracts with. The customer's basic information includes only the information that is in the market 
what is necessary is maintained centrally and other information is maintained as part of the contract information 
per party. At a high level, the distribution is done in such a way that the customer's name and address are read as the customer's information 
identification information as well as contact and postal address information. In the case of business customers, contact and 
the information of the company's head office is used in the postal address information. 
On the other hand, contract-specific information includes billing address and contact person information. Business customers 
in this case, in the contract-specific information, the information of the location to which the contract applies is indicated. 
You can also specify the customer's specification for the contract, which can be used to identify the contract 
for example, a company's department or place of business or a municipality's business. The same customer specification 
can be used when, in the case of a business customer, you want the company to appear on the contract 
auxiliary function name. The auxiliary name is not unique in its customer's datahub, because it uses the same one 
y code than the actual company to which the subsidiary name belongs. In order to avoid unnecessary information 
from multiple updating, special attention should be paid to the situation in which the information is 
what should be maintained in the customer's information and what information should be handled 
in the contract information.

3.1.2.1 
Customer type and identifier  
There are two types of customers in Datahub, which are consumer and business customers.  As business customers 
all legal entities (companies, associations, public actors) are processed and all are consumer customers 
natural persons. The customer is identified in the data hub with an identifier, which, depending on the customer type, is 
either personal identification number or y-identification number (or VAT identification number for foreign companies). Contracts can therefore 
report to datahub only in such a way that the customer data contains this identifier (special situations, 
where the party's own ID is used as an identifier, is described below). If a contract is made 
in the names of several customers, the information of all customers with their identifiers is reported, in which case the contract 
is connected to several customers in the data hub.  
In the case of foreign customers who do not yet have a Finnish personal identification number, it is possible 
the contract in this special situation informs datahub without an identifier, but then it must be notified 
customer's date of birth. In addition, the party's ID is reported to the datahub as the customer's ID 
identifier (so-called other identifier) ​​consisting of the seller's party identifier (GLN identifier) ​​and 
from the seller's customer ID. With the announcement of the new contract, the customer's created by the seller 
the identifier is also forwarded to the distribution system operator. Based on this, the seller and the distribution system operator 
can later identify the customer in the data hub. If the customer has a foreigner 
personal ID or an ID equivalent to this, it can be reported to datahub as the customer's additional ID 
in the field. 
It is the responsibility of the party that notified the agreement to update the customer's information in datahub as soon as 
personal identification number is available. After the update, all the customer's previous contracts are 
can be found using a new personal ID. Foreign customers are the only exception, when 
the contract can be reported to the consumer customer in datahub without the customer's identifier. 
The creation of anonymous customers in the data hub will be monitored.  
A private entrepreneur (more commonly known as a business name) is a business customer who is responsible 
personally from their contracts. All private entrepreneurs are granted a y-identification number 
when they register with the authorities. In the case of private traders, for business customers 
must be able to provide a personal identification number. In Datahub, private entrepreneurs are identified 
with the y code and the personal ID is entered in the customer's additional ID field. In this way, the customer can

on the basis of the ID, the private entrepreneur distinguishes the person in question from the person in question 
about the consumer customer. 
Business customers who do not have a business ID (e.g. certain consulates or road councils) are notified of the customer's 
as an ID, the party's own ID, which consists of the seller's party ID (GLN ID) and 
from the seller's customer ID. 
A separate information field is reserved for the customer for estates (colloquially often also inheritance). 
"Customer subtype", because often the handling of these customers differs from other customers 
in the parties' own business. With the help of the information field, the parties can improve their own efficiency 
their internal processes related to estates.  
If the company goes bankrupt, it is normal to do so in the name of the bankruptcy estate 
contract for a while, even if the bankruptcy estate does not yet have a new social security number. For a bankrupt estate that does not 
does not yet have a y ID, a new contract can be made by assigning this as the customer's subtype 
bankruptcy estate and creating the party's own identifier for this.  
3.1.2.2 
Correctness and maintenance of customer data 
The parties are responsible for the correctness of the customer information they provide to datahub. Datahub does not 
content validation of the information, such as checking whether the customer's name and social security number match each other. 
The parties must ensure that the name of the business customer is reported in the form it is 
in the official register (YTJ). In addition, it must be ensured that for a business customer in the customer information 
the stated postal address corresponds to the address of the main office stated in the official register (YTJ). 
Separate address information for the locations must be maintained in the contract information. 
The customer is created in datahub only as part of the contract processes. If sent by the party 
the customer in the contract notice cannot be found based on the identifier in datahub, let's create it 
as a new Customer record in datahub. If the customer can be found based on the identifier in the data hub, 
the contract to be notified is attached to the existing Customer-tiesupport. In addition to this, the customer 
the information is updated to match the customer information in the notification. If the contract is notified several times 
for the customer to be responsible for, i.e. there are more than one contractual partner in the party's contract notification, 
in datahub, several Customer records are attached to the contract. 
In Datahub, the main responsibility for maintaining customer information rests with the seller. They can update customer information 
sellers who have a valid contract with the customer. Customer information can be updated as a part 
contract processes or with a separate notification. In addition to this, the distribution system operator or a third party can 
sends a customer information update request to datahub, which is forwarded to the seller who is 
finally made a contract with the customer. This seller does the actual customer information 
update, because he can be assumed to have the most recent information about the customer. The seller can refuse 
about updating the information, if the seller considers that the update request is unwarranted or incorrect. The seller 
must respond to the update request by sending an update of the customer information to the data hub, which contains either 
information provided by the distribution system operator/3rd party (the seller accepts the update request), or in its own 
customer data in their system (the seller rejects the update request). If the seller does not respond 
to the update request within 2 business days, this is taken into account under the control of the datahub operator and

never be allowed to update. If the customer ID needs to be corrected for some reason, this will be reported 
to the datahub operator who will make the necessary correction. 
If the customer information is updated in the seller's own system and it does not cause any changes 
to the customer data maintained in the datahub, in this case there is no need to send an update of the customer data 
to datahub. Likewise, the distribution system operator or a 3rd party must send customer information 
update request only if the customer information maintained in the data hub has changed. When changed 
the information is stored in the datahub, the datahub forwards the customer information to all those parties who have either 
valid or future contracts or valid authorizations 
with the customer. According to the effective date of the change, Datahub checks who has it 
right to changed information. If the seller's contract has ended, datahub will forward the information 
of the change, if the effective date of the change is within 6 weeks of the end of the contract. 
In order to prevent the transmission of unnecessary or incorrect information, the parties must ensure that the updated 
the customer information is correct and the need to update is based on the need confirmed by the customer. Datahub 
check who has the right to the changed information according to the effective date of the change. 
If the seller's contract has ended, datahub will provide information about the change, if there is a change 
the effective date is within 6 weeks of the end of the contract 
In a situation where the sales and online contracts are in the names of different customers (a situation where their 
for contracts that were made before the implementation of the data hub, and whose information has been imported 
to datahub via data conversion), the network's customer information can be updated directly 
based on the request of the distribution network operator, if the customer does not have a single sales contract. 
The update of customer information is described in the following process diagram.

FIGURE 141414 CROSSING UPDATES 
3.1.2.3 
Encrypted clients 
Datahub enables the so-called going through the processes of "encrypted" customers. With an encrypted client 
means that the customer has been granted a restraining order or has himself refused 
transfer of his data and his data may not be forwarded. You can apply for a security ban 
from the registrar, if the person has a justified reason to doubt his or his family's safety 
at hazard. Encrypted customer does not mean a customer who has informed the party of the ban 
from transfer for direct marketing purposes. If there is an entry in the customer's information 
regarding the confidentiality of customer data, the information is forwarded in the normal way in contract processes 
from the seller to the distribution system operator. Information about confidentiality goes to the new contract 
along with the customer information attached to the notification, also to the information of the distribution system operator. Encrypted 
marked customers cannot give authorizations to 3rd parties. If the customer who is notified 
"encrypted" information, is the authorization given by the 3rd party at the time of notification, the authorization ends 
as a matter of routine. The information about the customer becoming encrypted is forwarded to the customer data 
according to the update event, to the customer's other sellers and distribution system operators normally. 
However, distribution system operators and sellers can forward these customers' data to datahub 
through in those situations where these market parties authorize 3rd parties to act 
in turn. However, the 3rd parties may not use the customer's information in these situations 
to anything other than what is agreed with the market party in the role of the market party 
to a working process. If the customer wants to remove the "encrypted" mark from his data, it is up to the customer 
change this information yourself in the datahub customer portal.  
3.1.3 
DH-130 Search for customer and usage location information 
The needs of the parties are mainly related to the search for customer and usage location information 
to contract processes. Consequently, a search functionality will be built into the data hub, which 
returns the data of the place of use, the data of the customers connected to the place of use with contracts, and the data 
in accordance with the rights of the requesting party regarding the contractual situation of the place of use. Search returns information

according to the rights presented in chapter 2.2. The search is described at a more detailed level 
in contract processes in chapter 3.2.2.  
In the search for customer and usage location information, the party must provide the usage location ID and 
depending on the search event, also the customer's identifier and/or the time from which the information is requested. 
There is a separate search for finding out the ID/basic information of the place of use, which the seller and a 3rd party use 
can search for basic information about the place of use with the address or ID of the place of use.  
The seller has the right to customer and usage location data for the duration of the contract. 
The seller has the right to maintain customer data in datahub from the time the contract is announced, it 
for the period of validity and, in addition, another 6 weeks after the end of the contract. The contract 
during the 6 weeks following the end and the data search for the same period returns 
up-to-date customer information, but only basic information about the place of use. 6 weeks is determined by the seller 
about the obligation to correct the customer's invoicing and the final invoice of the Electricity Market Act 
of the dispatch requirement in accordance with the current operating method. This 6 week contract 
from the end, the seller is called the "outgoing seller" in datahub's processes.  
In contrast to the previous one, with the customer's authorization, the seller can apply for a customer and user location 
information even without a valid contract. The principles of authorizations are described in more detail 
in chapter 3.9. 
Distribution system operators have rights to the usage location data of their own measurement areas, and therefore also 
to the customer data connected to these places of use with an online contract. Made by the distribution system operator 
the search for usage location information always returns the customer and 
online contract information if there is a customer at the point of use. 
3.1.4 
DH-140 Maintenance of energy community information 
On 22 December 2020, the State Council approved the report on electricity supplies andgiven from the measurement 
amendment of the government decree. Provisions on local were added to the regulation 
about the energy community and the group of active customers and their tasks. Coming into force 
in accordance with the regulation, the datahub deals with local energy communities and active customers 
group-related processes from the beginning of 2023. Both the energy community and the active ones 
the information of the customer group is maintained using the same energy community processes described below. 
Energy community information in the data hub can be maintained by the distribution network operator in the measurement area 
the energy community in question is.  
In accordance with the regulation, the energy community is notified to the distribution system operator 14 days before the community 
start of calculations. The distribution system operator must report the information to datahub no later than 7 days before 
the start of calculations. Energy community information can be reported by the community for 90 days at the earliest 
entry into force.  
The energy community is identified in the data hub with the party's own identifier. The identifier is generated 
such as the customer's own identifier (distribution system operator's GLN code + distribution system operator 
ID provided). The community identifier must be unique. In addition to the identifier, the distribution system operator 
enter the name of the community in datahub.

In addition to the identifier and name, the user location identifiers that belong to the community and 
the percentage share of these places of use in the energy produced by the community, which 
according to the share of production is deducted from the consumption of the place of use. Those belonging to the community 
the percentages of the places of use must be 100% in total and the individual place of use 
the percentage cannot be 100%. Percentages can be reported to two decimal places 
give or take. A place of use can only belong to one community at a time. For everyone's community 
the relevant usage locations must be part of the reporting distribution system operator's measurement area. 
According to the regulation, all places of use must be behind the same connection. Datahub doesn't have this 
there is no information about the connection, so the distribution system operator is responsible for the correctness of this information. Place of use, 
whose status is 'Removed' or 'Disabled' cannot be added to the energy community.  
The local energy community or a group of active customers decides whether the surplus energy is distributed 
for each use site belonging to the energy community based on its share (distribution method SMB, chap 
3.3.8.2) or in its entirety to the surplus utilization site defined for the energy community (distribution method 
SMA, chapter 3.3.8.1). This information is given when the community is created.  
If the allocation of the surplus is done per place of use (SMB), it will go to each community 
the consuming use place is connected to the small production use place, to which the surplus is allocated. If 
the consumption location is not associated with a (real) production location, the distribution system operator must create a so-called 
virtual place of use. The distribution system operator must create this virtual 
small production use place before establishing community data. For these virtual ones 
similar sales and network agreements must be made for small production locations as for normal ones 
for small production use. In the SMB sharing method, the energy community must also be assigned a separate one 
surplus production utilization site, to which the surpluses of any cut off are allocated 
in terms of places of use.  
If the surplus is allocated to only one Community Production Use Site (SMA), this will be the case 
the place of use specifies the surplus place of use for community information.  
Notification of a new energy community must also be made if the energy community's surplus distribution method 
changes (the distribution method cannot be changed with an update event). In this case, the decision is made using the old method of distribution 
existing energy community and a new energy community with a new distribution method is announced. This should be taken into account 
time limits in the notification of a new entity.   
With the update event, you can change the places of use belonging to the community. It is also in the update 
it should be noted that the distribution shares of the places of use must always be 100% in total and that the individual 
the distribution share of the place of use cannot be 100%. The distribution system operator must notify 
on the update of the energy community information no later than 7 days before the effective date of the change. 
The change can be made no earlier than 90 days before the effective date of the change.  
When the energy community decides its operations, the distribution system operator must also decide on the information 
from datahub. Termination is subject to the same time limits as updating community information, i.e 
termination must be notified at least 7 days before the end of the community. Closing event 
delete information about the energy community from the place of use belonging to the community on the date announced.  
Datahub informs the current vendor of the usage location as well as a possible oneto an authorized party 
information about the updating of the usage location information when the usage location is either added as a new one 
to the energy community or is removed from the energy community by updating or terminating the community.

3.2 
DH-300 Contract processes 
This chapter describes the processes related to point of use sales and online contracts. 
In principle, every time the seller makes a new contract in his own system, a notification is given 
from there to datahub. The distribution system operator confirms its own contract, if necessary 
to datahub always based on the seller's notification. If the seller or the distribution network operator makes changes 
to the contract information stored in the datahub, the changes are reported to the datahub and the datahub forwards them 
to the other party. At the end of the contract, both parties terminate their own contracts, and done 
the termination of the contract is communicated to the other party via datahub.  It cannot be at the place of use 
valid at the same time as one sales contract and one network contract, so datahub decides 
automatically of the previous contract when the place of use is notified of a new contract, and 
convey information about the terminated contract to the party whose contract was terminated. 
3.2.1 
Contract information 
The sales and network contract information stored in Datahub includes, among other things, the contract 
dates, billing address and contact information. When the parties announce the concluded 
contracts with datahub, the customer information provided in the notification is stored in datahub's Customer
to the entity (or to several, if the contract has more than one customer), and the contract 
is connected to the Customer (or customers) and to the notified in the data hub's internal data structure 
To the place of use. If the reported customer is still not found in the data hub, a new one is created in the data hub 
customer. In the case of a customer already found in the data hub, the customer's information is updated with the new one 
in connection with the announcement of the contract. Any changed customer information will be forwarded to everyone 
for parties who are entitled to customer data (see section 3.1.2.2 Correctness of customer data 
and maintenance) An individual contract is identified in datahub by the contract ID, 
with a combination of the location ID and the ID of the market party related to the contract. 
Contracts entered in Datahub are valid for whole days. The contract 
the start date is the first day the contract is valid. The contract 
the end date is the first day on which the contract is no longer valid. That's the deal 
starts at 00:00 on the effective date stated in the agreement notification. The contract ends again 
as the end date of the termination notice at 00:00, i.e. the day before the end date 
is the last day the contract is valid.  
Information about the invoicing channel is stored in the contract data, and according to this, the contract data will be entered 
attach the invoicing address information according to the desired invoicing channel (including invoicing (postal) address, 
email invoice address or online invoice address). A new contract for the customer's seller 
the invoicing address provided at the time of signing is forwarded from the seller via datahub 
to the distribution system operator. However, this information does not bind the distribution system operator to use the 
billing channel if this channel is not available. The distribution system operator informs the data hub 
information of the billing channel used in the contract as part of the online contract. The customer can too 
want the distribution network operator to send invoices to a different address than the sales invoice. Here 
the customer must contact the distribution system operator to change the billing address. 
The distribution system operator informs the data hub of the billing address change. Datahub's data model 
enables the use of separate billing addresses for the sales and

in connection with online contracts, i.e. billing address informationot is saved 
according to the contract. It is worth noting that consumers' e-invoice information is not, according to the current rules 
may convey from one party to another. Despite this, the invoicing channel field can state that 
the customer has requested this billing channel. Even if someone other than 
postal address, datahub must always inform the contract of any postal address possible 
for collection measures.  
The contract information contains information about the invoicing method of the contract, i.e. whether both the seller and 
the distribution network operator and the customer each separately, or whether it is either the seller's or 
joint invoicing by the distribution system operator. With similar sales and network contracts 
must be the same billing method. If a new sales contract does not result in a new online contract, 
if necessary, the distribution system operator must update the invoicing method of the network contract to match 
the invoicing method of the sales contract, or to contact the seller so that the seller knows how to update his own 
invoicing method of their contract. 
Contracts can include contact persons in addition to the actual customer. The customer is real 
contractual partner who is legally responsible for the contract. The contact persons are related to the contract 
persons whose contact information the parties need in customer service situations. For example, an invoice 
the recipient can be indicated as the contract's contact person, if it is different from the actual customer.  
Likewise, the contract contact persons may differ between sales and online contracts. To the customer 
the contact person's information provided to the seller in connection with the conclusion of a new contract 
is stored in the sales contract data, and forwarded to the distribution system operator. The distribution system operator can 
use these as contact persons for their own contract. It should be noted that the parties may have 
many different types of contact persons in their own customer and contract information, but to datahub 
the contact persons whose information needs to be passed on between the parties are indicated. 
Business customers must be notified of at least one contact person. Personal customers will be notified separately 
contact person only as needed, if the customer's contact information is not sufficient.  
The contract must state the way of doing business agreed with the customer. Transaction method "electronic" 
primarily means that no letter is sent to the customer. The way of doing business is contract-specific and 
the transaction method agreed by the seller with the customer is also forwarded to the distribution system operator for information. 
However, the distribution system operator must always agree on an electronic way of doing business with the customer 
separately, even though the seller has declared himself to be using an electronic transaction method. If for the contract 
the chosen transaction method is electronic, at least one of the customers connected to the contract must have one 
email address in contact information.  
Below are the sales and network contract information to be saved in the datahub in their own images. 
The place of use can have several contracts in a row in time, but only one sales contract 
the online contract can be valid at the same time. The contractual information transmitted in the processes is 
described in more detail in the event descriptions in the appendix Datahub events.

3.2.2 
DH-310 Notification of new contracts 
Information about contracts concluded with the customer must be reported to datahub. New contracts 
reporting to datahub is always initiated by the seller. However, this does not prevent the distribution system operator 
of the agreed online contract with the customer before the customer has signed 
sales contract with the seller. If the distribution network operator enters into a network contract before 
a new sales contract has been notified to datahub, the distribution system operator must wait for a new one 
notification of the sales contract from the datahub, and confirms the online contract to the datahub only after this 
after according to the normal process.  
Because datahub has an overall picture of the contract and customer situation of the place of use, not the seller's 
need to state datahubiin whether it is a customer move, change of vendor or renewal of the contract with the current vendor. Datahub deduces this from the contract and customer situation of the point of use stored in Datahub, and registers the new contract in Datahub accordingly. 
The following table shows the differences between the use of the current message traffic move and vendor change reason codes and the new reasons registered by Datahub.

One of the customers of the network and/or sales agreement is also involved in a

The customer concludes a new 
contract with their current 
vendor. 

The purpose is that the reasons would better reflect the real 
reason for concluding a new sales agreement. A new term "Contract change" is being introduced in Datahub. This refers to concluding a new 
sales agreement for the customer's current point of use with the current vendor. 
Datahub registers the reason for concluding a new agreement depending on whether the customers reported in the new agreement differ from the customers of the agreements in force in Datahub at the point of use, i.e. whether the 
customer or customers of the new agreement have sales or 
network agreements at the point of use at the time the agreement is concluded. If customers change completely at the point of use, both in terms of the network

and the sales contract, this is usually a relocation situation, in which case the contract can be notified at the earliest for the current day. The contract can also be notified for the current day when the point of use is without a seller or when the current seller makes a so-called contract change in accordance with the table above. In all other cases, the 14-day time limit is observed, taking into account the fixed terms of the contracts. If the seller notifies of a new contract for the current day, the network company may exceptionally notify the confirmation of the network contract in these situations retroactively to correspond to the start date of the sales contract. The contract can be notified to Datahub no earlier than 90 days after the notification. If the seller has made a new contract with the customer to start later than 90 days and nevertheless notifies the contract to Datahub within the time limits of Datahub, the seller must ensure that the reason for the start of the contract corresponds to the contract made with the customer. If the vendor has 
agreed with the customer to change vendor and the reason information returned is ‘Movement’, the vendor must 
contact the customer and verify the situation with the customer. The following table provides a 
summary of the reasoning made by Datahub, according to which new contracts are registered for 
each reason. Datahub’s reason classification is primarily used for statistical purposes.

is registered as moving in. If the seller or the distribution system operator just changes the customer's information 
and the contract continues with the deceased person's social security number, the change can be reported in the customer information 
as an update (see 3.1.2). If, however, a new contract is made in this situation, it will be notified 
a new sales contract to datahub, which is registered as a contract exchange. Estate customers 
is distinguished from other customers by a separate customer subtype data field. 
Before announcing a new contract, the seller can, if necessary, request information about the place of use 
from datahub as authorized by the customer. The rights to data are described in chapter 2.2 of this document. 
The purpose of the preliminary information survey is to make it easier for the seller to understand what kind of contract it is 
to the place of use, it is possible for the customer in question to do so. The ID of the place of use is given to the query 
and the IDs of the customer or customers. As feedback from the survey, the seller receives a customer and usage location 
in addition to the information, information about the contractual status of the place of use as follows: 
• 
Does the customer have a valid sales contract at the place of use or not 
• 
If the customer has a sales contract at the place of use, information is returned on whether the customer is or 
the customers are exactly the same as the new contract's future customers. 
• 
Does the current sales contract at the place of use prevent the customer entering into a new contract (if 
such is) to the place of use of concluding a new contract, i.e. when the customer remains unchanged 
and: 
a) The sales contract is temporary. In addition, the expiration date of the term, 
if it is within 90 days from the time of data retrieval 
b) The sales contract has an unusual termination clause 
• 
If the place of use has already been notified of the future termination of the contract, this will be returned 
date, so that the seller can agree on the start of the new contract without anything happening in between 
interruption of delivery. 
• 
If the place of use has already been notified of the start of a new contract, this will be returned 
the date when the seller can only enter into a contract for a period before previously announced 
contract (see example 3 in chapter 3.2.2.4) 
• 
Does the customer have a valid network contract at the place of use or not 
• 
If the customer has an online contract at the place of use, information about whether the customer or customers are 
exactly the same as the future customers of the new contract. 
From the customer's data, only the data of the customer or customers whose identifier is returned 
is given in the application. If the contract has other customers, the information is returned in the contract situation 
that the contract has other customers, but not the information of these customers. 
Corresponding validations are also performed when the seller announces a new contract to datahub.

In the future, the term customer also means all customers of the contract when customers 
is more than one. It is also worth noting that the customers and their change at the place of use 
identified in datahub by customer identifiers (hetu, y-identifier, party's own identifier) 
basis, not by name alone. 
3.2.2.1 
Creation of an online contract 
Datahub infers the information of the seller's announcement and the place of use from its current customer and 
about the contract situation, whether a new network contract is needed. When it comes to moving in, let's do it 
new online contract always. When it comes to a change of vendor or contract, a new one is needed 
network agreement in those situations where the valid network agreement of the place of use is different 
with the customer as a future sales contract. This practice ensures that in the future the place of use 
sales and online contracts will be concluded for the same customers. Although customers with contracts 
would be the same, a new online contract is also needed if the new online contract is about to expire 
during the sales contract, or if the online contract is pending cancellation notified by the seller 
based on the cancellation of the sales contract. A new online contract is also required if the contracts 
The "electricity supply agreement" fields do not match each other. The field in question will be checked again 
between and existing sales contract or, if no previous sales contract is valid, 
but a valid online contract is found, the review is done for a new sales contract and 
between an existing network contract. If a new network contract is not needed, don't care 
datahub for the distribution system operator, however, information about the new sales contract. In this situation 
the seller gets the necessary information about the location of use and e.g. network agreement of the place of use 
after the product information sales contract comes into force, location of use and customer information 
at the application event.  
If a new online contract is needed, datahub creates a new one based on the seller's notification 
network contract information to the status "unconfirmed". Datahub sends a notification to the distribution system operator 
of the new network contract, which the distribution system operator confirms to the data hub with its own 
with his notification. An unconfirmed contract from Datahub is formed 
in the datahub, own contract ID, which the distribution system operator must replace in its own system 
with the existing contract code. The distribution system operator may have entered into an agreement earlier 
with the customer, in which case the details of the contract are sent as confirmation at this stage 
to datahub. Information about the distribution system operator's confirmation is also forwarded to the seller, in which case the seller receives 
information necessary for their knowledge of the online agreement, such as product information.  
If necessary, the distribution system operator will connect the electricity to the place of use on the day of the start of delivery. The seller does not 
need to send a separate connection request, the distribution network operator will connect the electricity again 
based on the contract notification. The connection is announced with the connection notification according to chapter 3.4. 
If the distribution system operator cannot connect electricity to the place of use when the contract starts, this will notify 
regarding this to the seller outside the datahub. In the contract information forwarded to the distribution system operator, 
the seller will provide information on whether the place of use is critical for interruption upon signing the contract 
due to the special needs of the customer and/or the resident living at the place of use. Interrupt critical 
the point of use should not be disconnected under normal circumstances, but that information does not guide how 
the distribution network operator controls the power cut at the point of use, for example, if possible 
in the event of a power shortage.

The operators are responsible for checking the customer's legal capacity before concluding the contract 
and reporting it to datahub. The responsibility for the inspection is always on the party that signed the contract 
with the customer does. Datahub has a validation that prevents the announcement of a new contract 
for a minor customer. The distribution system operator has the right not to enter into a network contract 
with the customer based on the seller's notification. In this case, the distribution system operator informs the data hub, 
does not confirm the online agreement, and states the reason why the confirmation cannot be made. This information 
forwarded to the seller. If the distribution system operator does not confirm the resulting network contract, it is up to the seller 
to cancel the announced sales contract, on the basis of which a new online contract has been created 
to be confirmed.

3.2.2.3 
Code 
In Datahub, the contract start date refers to the day from which the seller has 
the right to measurement data and from when the seller is responsible for the consumption or production of the place of use 
in its own balance sheet. In practice, this date also corresponds to the day from which 
the seller has the right to invoice the customer.  
In the current situation, a lot of investigation work is causing the same place of use for the same or close ones 
new sales contract announcements made for the dates. It will be clear in Datahub 
the rules, under what conditions and for what period of time new sales contracts can be announced for the place of use. 
The main principle is that two or more cannot be valid on the same date at the same time 
sales contract at the same place of use. The contracts are always valid for full days, i.e 
the agreement enters into force on the day it starts at 00:00 and the agreement ends at the end of the day.  
The rules for notifications to the same place of use are as follows: 
1. A new sales contract can be announced as starting on the current day whenever the place of use is 
without a seller 
2. Moving in must be announced no later than the current day and no earlier than 90 days 
before the start date of the contract. 
3. In situations of contract exchange (see tablekko 9) a new sales contract can be announced 
to start for the current day. 
4. In situations other than the three above, a new sales contract must be notified 
at least 14 days later and no earlier than 90 days before the contract 
start date. 
5. A new sales contract that has been successfully notified to datahub is automatically terminated 
the new sales contract of the sales contract valid on the starting date 
for the day before the start date (also applies to situations where the previous customer is 
reported moving out to a later date when the end date 
will be updated to earlier). 
6. At the place of use, containing temporary or different terms of termination 
according to its validity, the sales contract prevents new ones announced by the new seller 
sales contracts where the customer or one of the customers is the same as the place of use 
in the valid sales contract.  
a. As an exception, a consumer customer's fixed-term contract does not prevent a new seller 
announced sales contract, if the term of the contract has continued beyond 2 
years. 
7. All customers moving in the place of use (moving in) will automatically cancel 
all on the same or later date start with the current of the same place of use 
the customer's new sales contracts (example 4 of chapter 3.2.2.4).

8. Two new contracts cannot be announced as starting on the same day, but later 
the announced agreement is rejected (example 2 of chapter 3.2.2.4). As an exception to the rule of section 7, 
in which case the current customer's new contract first made for the same day will be cancelled, if 
the place of use will be informed of the contract in which all customers will change. 
9. Before the entry into force of the new sales contract previously notified to the place of use, it is possible 
"in between" indicates a new sales contract, but then the end date of the contract comes 
announces and it cannot be later than the previously announced contract 
start date (example 3 of chapter 3.2.2.4). As an exception, the rule of section 7. Datahub 
record the termination reason for this as 'Dismissal'. 
10. Contracts can only be notified retroactively in cases of error correction. 
All notices of commencement, termination or renewal of the sales contract which result 
to the overlapping sales contract and which are not separately mentioned above, will be rejected. 
The group of active customers mentioned in the legislation related to energy communities can hold 
including both consumer and business customers. If such a group of active customers wants 
announces the contract to the group's small-scale production location, making the contract to everyone in the group 
in the name of the customers, the rules related to the contract are treated like consumer
by the customer (e.g. deviations cannot be reported to the contract of a group of active customers 
terms of termination).  
3.2.2.4 
Examples 
The following examples are used to describe close or overlapping sales contracts 
processing of notices in the data hub so that duplicate contracts do not arise. 
Example 1: contracts announced for the place of use with a different start date come into force 
consecutively, regardless of whether the seller's announcements are made on the same day or on a different day.

Example 2: A previously announced contract for the same starting date for the place of use prevents a new one 
for the same start date of concluding the contract, i.e. datahub rejects the latter seller 
of notification (B). 
 
 
Example 3: An agreement notified to the place of use in the future prevents an earlier start 
entering into an indefinite contract. Such a situation may arise 
for example, when the landlord wants to renovate his apartment before the new tenant

move and the tenant has already had time to make a future contract for the place of use. In the present case 
datahub can only be entered into an agreement (B) "between" which ends before the previously announced date 
contract (A) start date. The notification of the new contract (B) must then state 
contract end date. The seller is informed of the agreementthe start date of contract A at the stage when it makes a preliminary query of the usage point information before the notification of the new contract, 
based on which it knows on which date contract B must be terminated. 

Example 4: A move-in notification for the usage point cancels all previously notified future 
seller or contract changes.

Situation after notification of Agreement B: 

3.2.2.5 
Fixed-term sales agreements 
The fixed-term nature of a sales agreement is reported to Datahub by notifying such an agreement of the 
start date of the fixed-term and the end date of the fixed-term. It should be noted that 
in the Datahub data model, these are different information than the start and 
end dates of the agreement. The start date of the agreement is always the correct start time of the agreement. 
The end date of the agreement is only saved when the termination of the agreement is reported to Datahub or Datahub terminates the agreement automatically. 
The fixed-term nature of sales contracts will be taken into account in Datahub using the same principles as in the current model. The main rule is that a fixed-term contract can be terminated early if the customer moves away from the location of use. In Datahub, contracts are always examined on a site-by-site basis, so even if the seller and the customer have agreed to continue the fixed-term contract at the customer's new location of use, from Datahub's perspective these are two different contracts for different locations of use, in which case the first contract can be terminated in Datahub. 
In Datahub, a fixed-term contract prevents a new seller from concluding a new sales contract in a situation where even one customer in the current sales contract at the location of use is the same as the contracting parties to the new sales contract (cases 4 and 5 in Table 7 of Chapter 3.2.2). 
The customer can agree on contract changes and new contract terms with their current seller flexibly. Therefore, the customer can agree to remove and add parties to their contract, for example in the event of a separation with their current vendor, even if the customer's current contract is for a fixed term. However, the fixed term of the current contract prevents the notification of a new vendor's contract to Datahub. The fixed term of the contract does not prevent the vendor from terminating the sales contract with a separate termination notification. 
The following table summarizes the deadlines for notifying contracts to Datahub in different situations, the effect of the fixed term, and the reason for notifying a new contract registered by Datahub.

Rules for processing fixed-term contracts in Datahub: 
1. A fixed-term sales contract is deemed to continue to be valid until further notice if the termination of the contract or the renewal of the fixed-term contract is not separately 
notified to Datahub. 
2. A new seller may notify a consumer customer who has a fixed-term sales contract of a new 
sales contract if the fixed-term nature of the contract has continued for at least 2 years. 
3. If the current seller wishes to terminate the current fixed-term contract and continue the 
contract with a new one for at leastwhile some of the current customers remain the same, new ones 
the contract can be reported directly to datahub.

3.2.2.6 
Different terms of termination 
The seller can agree on different terms of termination for non-consumer customers in the contract. 
According to the data model described earlier, the sales contract has information about whether the contract contains 
different terms of termination. In contracts where the customer's notice period is longer than usual (14 
days) is different, the seller must notify this different notice period. In others 
in the information on unusual notice terms, either the length of the unusual notice period must be stated 
days, or a date range within which a new sales contract can be started. If necessary, the seller 
must report updated information in these respects every day.  
For example, if the seller has a contract that can be terminated on the 5th of every month, the seller must 
continuously update the information to reflect the next possible day according to the notice period, 
when a new sales contract can be started. The indicated date (or date range) will 
to state the day or time when the new sales contract can be started, and not the day when 
the customer has the right to terminate the contract. If the seller states the date range is the first 
the indicated day is the day when the new contract can start and the last day is the day when it can no longer be 
start a new contract. In the case of the example, a specific single day can be reported 
as a date range, where the end date is the day after the start date.  
According to its rules, a deviating termination clause in the contract prevents a new sales contract 
making to the customer's current place of use corresponding to the current place of use 
fixed-term sales contract. The new seller will be notified of the unusual termination condition 
the start date of the first possible contract, even when this is more than 90 days 
off. However, even in this case, the contract cannot be notified for more than 90 days 
on.   
3.2.3 
DH-320 Notification of contract changes 
Whenever a party makes changes in its own system to the data stored in the data hub, 
changes must be reported to datahub. When updating the contract, the contract to be updated is identified 
by means of a combination of contract ID, market party and usage location ID. For contracts 
the changes to be made are reported to datahub according to the following rules: 
1. You cannot add or remove customers to the contract with an update event, but in this case there will be 
announces a new sales contract. The contract's customer information cannot be updated either 
with contract update. Updating the customer's information is described in chapter 3.1.2. 
2. By updating the contract, the start or end time of the contract cannot be changed. To Datahub 
the start or end dates of the sales contract can be changed before these 
dates (i.e. not retroactively) only in such a way that the original is reported to datahub first 
cancellation of the notification and then a new notification with a new date. 
3. Change of the start and end dates of the sales contract after the delivery has started or already 
after completion is described in chapter 3.2.5.

4. Both contracts valid at the time of notification and those coming into force in the future may 
update. A sales contract that has already ended at the time of notification can only be updated if the contract 
there are less than 6 weeks until the end. An expired online contract can be updated without 
corresponding limitation. 
5. Changes to the content of the agreement, where the party updates the existing agreement 
information, is done with contract update events. Changes to the content of the agreement are 
e.g. product changes or changes affecting invoicing information, abnormal 
changes to the terms of termination and changes to the term of the sales contract.  
6. The sales contract can be updated from non-temporary by updating the contract 
temporary or vice versa. The beginning and end of the term of the fixed-term contract 
end times can be updated. 
7. The contract cannot be upgraded from a regular electricity supply contract or vice versa. Here 
need to report a new sales contract to datahub. 
8. Osthere will be no updates to the contract information made by the helper in his own system 
sends an update message to the datahub if the update does not change those maintained in dahub 
contract information. 
9. The update of contract information should not automatically cause another event, such as 
for example, updating the customer's postal address, unless the information has also changed 
regarding 
During the delivery, the parties can also update the customer's information, such as the customer's name or 
contact information. This information is reported to datahub as a separate update of customer information. 
The contract cancellation and correction processes are described in more detail in chapter 3.2.5. 
3.2.4 
DH-330 Notice of Termination of Contracts 
As described above, the notification of the new sales contract terminates the previous one of the place of use 
the contract automatically changes the start date of the new contract to the previous day. In addition to this 
it is possible to notify datahub separately of the termination of contracts. In these cases 
the main principle is that the notification that terminates the contract in datahub, i.e. records the contract 
the end date is always done by the party whose contract ends. Datahub sends 
of the termination of the contract to the notification to the other party, who decides (his own process 
in accordance with) his own agreement in his own system, and informs about this on his own 
with a notice of termination to datahub. Datahub can, however, terminate the customer's contract 
via the seller also informs the customer of the new place of use, in which case the termination notice is forwarded 
to the distribution system operator of the place of use. In this case, the distribution system operator must do the actual work 
ending the contract with the data hub, as you would do in a situation where the customer announces they are moving out 
to the distribution system operator directly. 
In a situation where the seller no longer has the conditions to operate in the electricity retail market, either the seller 
due to bankruptcy or because the seller no longer has a balance sheet manager, the datahub operator can decide

all contracts of the seller in a mass transaction. The event is sent to the distribution system operator 
notice of termination for each terminated contract with the reason 'Termination of the seller's activity'. 
At the same time, the transaction also cancels any future contracts of that seller and sends 
of these, a cancellation notice to the distribution system operator with the reason 'Seller has canceled the contract'. 
The termination of the agreement is always notified to datahub with the same termination notice, and the reason 
until the end is announced with the reasons shown in the following table.  
After receiving the notice of termination of the online contract, the seller must always terminate his own 
corresponding sales contract at the same place of use. When the seller announces his sales contract 
termination to the data hub as a move out, the distribution system operator must decide on its own 
their online agreement. In such contract terminations where the data hub is expected 
conclusion of a corresponding sales or online contract to be notified, the notification is allowed 
sending outside of normal time limits. This is how contract terminations can be announced 
for the same days. For example, if the seller announces the termination of the sales contract for the current day 
moving out with the reason, the network company can respond with the same moving out date with its own 
with the eviction notice retroactively, so that the eviction dates correspond to each other. If to the data hub 
notified termination of the contract pending notification of termination by the other party is this 
to be notified no later than seven days later. Notifications that came later 
will be accepted, but repeatedly late notifications will be ignored.

Separate move-in and move-out notices 
The move-in notified to the place of use ends the current one of the possible place of use 
sales contract. However, if necessary, the current seller can announce a separate one after this 
moving out no later than the day before moving in. If moving out is announced 
for an earlier date than the previously announced move-in, the contract will be updated 
end date to match the eviction notice. In this case, the previously announced move-in 
and there is a period of time without a contract between the eviction notice announced later, from which datahub 
inform the distribution system operator. If a separate move out has been announced, the customer will not be returned 
for the current seller in a possible cancellation of a new contract.

3.2.4.3 
A separate move-out notification as part of the customer's move-in 
Even in the case of a customer moving, you must be able to serve the customer in such a way that the customer can decide 
contract of the move-out destination by notifying the seller of the move-in destination only. This one 
to make this possible, the datahub has its own event that the seller of the move-in target can use to notify 
of the customer's move-out from the customer's move-out destination to the data hub. This notice is forwarded 
from the data hub to the distribution network operator of the relocation destination. The distribution system operator of the emigration destination 
is responsible, if necessary, to terminate their network contract and notify datahub accordingly, as 
in a situation where the customer would have notified the distribution network operator of the move out. This process 
with this, the notification of the termination of the contract is then forwarded from the data hub to the relocation destination 
to the seller. The seller of the move-in property must provide at least one customer who has 
contract at the move-out destination, identification information for notification. In order to notify the customer 
moving out to datahub, the seller must first inform datahub of the customer's new sales contract. 
The distribution system operator can contact the customer of the network agreement if the move-in target 
the seller has not announced all the customers of the contract. Separate from the seller of the move-in property 
the move-out notification cannot be canceled in datahub. If the seller discovers that he has sent a notice 
incorrectly, the seller must be in direct contact with the relevant distribution system operator.

In a situation where the customer disputes the new sales contract and the seller does not agree to the contract 
to cancel or terminate, must cancel or terminate the sales contract 
enables the use location upon notification by the distribution system operator. However, you will not come to Datahub 
in the first step, to build functionality for the transmission of the objection notification and 
for concluding contracts. In the first stage, the situations are handled manually so that 
the distribution system operator notifies the objection in writing to the data hub operator, who cancels the objection 
contract and forwards the information to the seller. The industry will monitor how many customers come 
to dispute contracts, and with that it will be decided whether a different type is needed for the data hub 
functionality for handling disputes. 
Denying the contract in the future cancels the contract and the balance sheet information as well as the seller 
canceled the contract. In contesting the agreement, retroactive determination of balance sheet information 
differs from the contract cancellations described earlier. In this case, regarding the denial 
the balance sheet information is also affected by whether the disputed contract started within the balance sheet window or not 
outside and whether the customer had a contract at the place of use that has ended this disputed 
based on the contract. If the disputed contract has started within the balance window (disputing 
notice – 11 days) and there is a seller at the place of use, for whom the contract will be reinstated, the balance sheets will be corrected 
normally within the balance window between the previous seller. If the disputed contract has started 
outside the balance window and at the place of use, there is a seller, for whom the contract will be reinstated, is responsible 
the seller of the disputed contract from the balance sheets for the period of the closed balance window. In situations where 
there is no old seller at the place of use to whom the contract is returned, corresponds to the disputed contract 
seller from the balance sheets until a new seller or distribution system operator appears at the place of use 
cuts off the electricity.  
The denial of the contract by the operator is described in more detail in chapter 3.14.1, where 
the repair processes performed by the operator to the contract data are described.  
3.2.4.5 
DH-323 Vendor-free places of use 
So that the distribution network operator can, if he wishes, terminate his own network contract and/or cut off the electricity 
from the point of use, datahub sends notifications of points of use without vendors to the distribution system operator. 
Notifications of locations without vendors are sent daily. The notification will indicate when 
the place of use remained or is about to remain without a seller, and when the seller-free period is ending, if 
datahub has a sales contract that will start at a later date for the place of use. Datahub sends 
announcements about even short periods without sellers.  
It should be noted, however, that datahub does not send notifications about places of use that are in data conversion 
are brought connected and without a seller.  
3.2.5 
DH-340 Cancellation of contracts and correction of errors 
Agreements are canceled when the customer exercises his right to cancel according to the law, home and 
in distance selling situations and to correct incorrect contracts. General principle with cancellation 
is that the contract is canceled from the start date of the contract. Based on the reason for cancellation is 
however, there are some exceptions to the situation, which will be opened in later examples. The real ones

in addition to the cancellation of contracts, only false information caused by mistakes of the parties can be made 
correct by announcing retroactive contract initiations or terminations. Retrospective is meant 
that the start date of the announced contract or the end date of the concluded contract is scheduled 
for any day prior to the announcement. More generally, retroactive change is meant 
amendment that changes any validity of the sales contract in the past.  
With regard to retroactive changes, it is essential that the data hub is maintainedby workplace 
separately, both the validity of the balance sheet (balance sheet information) and the validity of the sales contract 
(contract information). The balance sheet information tells which seller's balance sheet the consumption or production of the place of use 
is calculated in datahub's balance sheet calculations. If the balance sheet information is accessed outside the balance sheet window 
changes over time, this is taken into account when handling balance sheet errors. The contract information tells you who has it 
the seller has the right to data about the place of use (including measurement data) in datahub. Contract information 
corresponds to the time from which the seller has the right to bill the customer. Under normal circumstances, balance sheet information 
corresponds to contract information. The balance sheet information may differ from the contractual information when retroactive corrections are made. 
3.2.5.1 
Cancellation of the sales contract 
Sales contracts are canceled when the customer cancels the contract using the statutory provisions 
right of cancellation or in error situations where there is a sales contract or possibly an online contract 
made for the wrong place of use or otherwise on the wrong grounds. Cancellation can be made before 
the beginning of the contract or retroactively after the beginning of the contract. These two cases 
the cancellation process is handled differently in datahub. 
The seller must notify datahub of the cancellation of the contract. Can be canceled in most situations 
the sales contract was originally decided by the previous seller of the place of use when it was announced 
of the sales contract, in which case this will be reinstated upon cancellation. No refunds will be made 
for a contract that has been concluded with a separate termination event (seller's own notification or 
mass termination of contracts by the operator). It has been agreed in the industry that the previous seller should 
take the customer back into his sales, unless it is a fixed-term contract of the customer, which is already in place 
finished. If the seller of the previous contract does not want the customer back, the latter can refuse 
on the return of the contract (transaction DH-343). Refusal to return the contract is responsible 
termination of the contract and it always uses termination as the reason for the termination of the contract. If 
the seller of the previous contract wants to end the contract with something else after the cancellation 
with the reason for termination, the termination is announced as a normal termination of the contract with the event DH-
331. In moving-in situations, there is not always a previous seller at the place of use, so in those situations 
the contract cannot naturally be returned. 
The sales contract that can be canceled (moving in) can also be canceled when initially notified 
future sales contracts and authorizations, which will be reinstated upon cancellation of move-in 
in connection with.  
In case of contract cancellation, the seller/authorization of the previous/future sales contract 
the party is no longer an active party in the datahub, no sales contract/authorization of course 
be reinstated. If the place of use remains in a state without a contract, a notification will be sent here 
to the distribution system operator.

Contracts imported in Datahub's data conversion cannot be canceled with normal ones 
with cancellation events. In data conversion, the contract situation at a certain point in time is brought to the data hub 
systems of the parties and does not bring information about the contract history of the place of use to the data hub. Hence 
datahub cannot review the status of previous contracts and restore old contracts 
into effect if necessary, such as in the case of cancellations of contracts introduced through datahub's processes. Provided 
the contract imported in the data conversion must be cancelled, the party informs the datahub operator of this, 
who can perform the cancellation on behalf of the party.  
In his notice of cancellation, the seller must indicate whether it is a cancellation made by the customer or 
cancellation by the seller. The customer's cancellation can be, for example, based on the customer's right to cancel 
cancellation made or cancellation based on incorrect information provided by the customer. If 
the customer's cancellation concerns the contract announced as move-in, it is possible for the seller to notify 
also that the customer's contract in question is cancelled, but the move-in itself is not cancelled. If 
the contract only, but not moving in, is cancelled, no possible previous sales contract 
be returned to the place of use.  
In the case of retroactive customer cancellations made after the start of the contract, the seller retains the right 
invoicing right/contract information from the beginning of the contract, counting to the period from which the balance settlement window is 
withdrawn. In these cases, datahub cannot automatically restore the previous seller 
contract into force, because despite the cancellation, a period remains from the contract to be canceled, 
during which the said agreement is valid. In this case, datahub will inform the previous seller 
the date from which the seller of the starting contract can notify datahub retroactively, if he wishes 
customer back. AlThe graphs on la show what the customer did before the start of the contract 
cancellation (1), cancellation made by the customer before the start of the contract, when the contract but not 
move-in is canceled (2) and retroactive cancellation (3). If retroactive cancellation (3) is made 
within the balance sheet window, the contract and balance sheet information are automatically returned completely to seller A.

FIGURE 222222 THE SITUATION AFTER THE NOTIFIED CUSTOMER'S CANCELLATION IN A SITUATION IN WHICH 
THERE IS NO PREVIOUS SELLER AT THE LOCATION 
Cancellations by the seller are due to various error situations caused by the seller. In these cases 
datahub forwards the information about the cancellation of the sales contract to the place of use (if any) 
to the previous seller and the previous sales contract is automatically reinstated. If the preceding 
there is no seller, the place of use remains without a seller in retroactive cancellations until the date of cancellation 
from the next day. The previous seller can, on the basis of a cancellation notice that has been forwarded 
notify datahub of the termination of your own sales contract without a 14-day time limit, when 
the decision is made during the business day following the notification of cancellation. End date can be 
the earliest the start date of the canceled contract, when the cancellation is made before the contract 
the start date or the date of notification of cancellation when the cancellation is made on the start date of the contract 
after. 
In the graphs below, it is shown as a cancellation by the seller before the start of the contract 
processing of canceled sales contracts in datahub. Figure 5 shows a situation where the seller 
B cancels his contract before the start of the contract and by default seller A's contract 
will be reinstated. Figure 6 shows a similar situation where seller A announces his own 
of the termination of his contract to datahub based on the notification of seller B. According to figure 6 
processing is also followed when the event is registered as a customer cancellation.

PICTURE 232323 SELLER'S CANCELLATIONS BEFORE THE START OF THE CONTRACT. SITUATION 
AFTER THE NOTIFICATION OF CANCELLATION (5) AND THE SITUATION OF THE POSSIBLE PREVIOUS SELLER 
AFTER REFUSAL (6). 
In Datahub, cancellations made after the start of the contract are processed in such a way that seller B 
the cancellation of the contract is registered on the date of notification of the cancellation. Seller A receives a notification 
of the canceled contract and without further measures the expired contract of seller A is returned 
effective in datahub. After receiving the notification, seller A can decide on his own as mentioned above 
their sales contract without time limit validation (such as moving out) by the following at the latest 
on a weekday. However, seller A cannot terminate the contract retroactively, but always only 
to the end of the current day or to a later day. After the next business day, seller A 
normal time limits for termination apply to the contract.  
Figure 7 below shows a situation where seller B cancels his contract with the data hub 
after the start of the contract and seller A does not terminate his own contract. The balance sheet is corrected for seller A 
only within the balance window. If the cancellation is made within the balance window, the balance information will be corrected 
entirely to seller A. Diagram 8 shows a similar situation where seller A decides his own 
his contract. The place of use remains in a vendor-free state in accordance with vendor A's notice of termination. 
Datahub informs the distribution system operator of the location without a vendor.

If, in the case of retroactive cancellation by the seller, there is no previous sales contract at the point of use, the 
use point will remain in a seller-free state for the entire period after cancellation. However, seller B is responsible for the balances until the cancellation date in accordance with figure 9. If seller B becomes aware of a customer who has used electricity at the point of use during this period, seller B may notify the retroactive commencement of the 
sales contract after having agreed on it with the customer in question.

FIGURE 262626 CANCELLATION BEFORE THE START OF THE AGREEMENT WHEN THERE IS NO PREVIOUS SELLER 
If a sales agreement following the agreement to be cancelled has already been reported to Datahub for the same 
location, when the previous agreement is reinstated, this will only be reinstated until the 
start date of the new agreement, as shown in figures 11 and 12. If a retroactive 
cancellation (12) is made within the balance window, the balance information will be completely corrected for the previous seller A until the 
start date of the new agreement.

AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED IN THE FUTURE 
Figure 13 shows the processing of agreement and balance information when the customer cancels the agreement after its 
start and a new agreement has already been announced in the future for the relevant location. Since 
contract B remains in force for a period outside the balance window, the contract of seller A cannot be 
automatically reinstated in Datahub. As in the case of figure 3, seller A is informed of the date from which he can notify the contract to start if he wants the customer back. 
If a retroactive cancellation is made within the balance window, the contract and balance information is 
automatically returned to the previous seller A until the start date of the new contract.

If the cancellation of the agreement is made after the start of the agreement and the previous agreement has 
had an expiry date, the previous agreement will be reinstated with the previous expiry date, when 
it is a seller's cancellation (figure 16). If it is a retroactive customer cancellation,

time of cancellation (figure 15). In both cases, the balance responsibility remains with the canceling 
seller until the moment of cancellation.

If the contract to be canceled has an end date in datahub, it does not affect the validity 
to be returned to the previous seller's contract. If the previous agreement did not initially have

if the place of use has already announced a new contract for the future, the previous contract 
will be returned until the start date of the contract that comes into force (figures 18 and 19). If retrospective

based on this, the old network contract is automatically reinstated in datahub if this 
the online contract has been concluded in connection with the creation of the sales contract that can be canceled in datahub.  
In the case of cancellation of the online contract and reinstatement of the old online contract 
similar rules apply to the contractual situation stored in datahub 
in the processing of the sales contract. When the online contract is cancelled, a possible previous one 
the online contract at the place of use is reinstated. If the previous online contract had 
known end date before the contract to be canceled was announced, previous contract 
will be reinstated only up to the respective expiration date. If you have already reached the future 
announces a new online agreement, the previous online agreement can only be reinstated 
until the start of the online contract. If the cancellation is made retroactive to the closing of the balance window 
after cancellation by the customer, the previous online contract does not come back into force, but 
the canceled online contract remains in effect until the closing of the balance window and 
is canceled from then on. If there is no previous online agreement, the place of use remains the online agreement 
when canceling without an online contract. As an exception to the previous one, if the online contract is cancelled 
retroactively due to cancellation of the customer and there is no previous online contract, must be cancelled 
the online contract is canceled only from the moment of notification of cancellation. In this case, it must be cancelled 
the online contract remains valid in datahub from its start date until the moment of notification of cancellation.  
If the contract cancellation notified to datahub is pending notification from the other party 
cancellation, this must be reported no later than seven days later. Later 
notifications of cancellations received are accepted, but for notifications that are repeatedly received late 
will be addressed.

3.2.5.4 
DH-351 and DH-352 Cancellation of termination of contracts 
Terminations of the sales and online contract notified to the contracts can be canceled on their own 
with their events. Termination can be canceled if the termination of the contract has been announced 
into the future and there is no new contract starting at the place of use after the end date.  
Contract terminations introduced in the data conversion cannot be canceled. If in data conversion 
the imported contract is intended to continue despite the announced termination, there is a contract 
to be continued by notifying the place of use of a new contract from the end date onwards.  
3.2.5.5 
Retroactive error correctionthe seeds 
Retrospective changes to the start and end dates of the contracts should only be made in the clear 
in error situations. In retroactive corrections, the main rule is that the balance sheet is determined to have made an error 
according to the seller and contract information according to who should have the right to bill the customer. 
The principle is therefore that the seller who made the mistake is responsible for the balance sheet, even if he has no right 
bill the customer. 
The seller announces the retroactive sales contract with the same announcement as in the future 
of the starting sales contract. The announcement of the new retroactive sales agreement is proceeding as normal 
process, if there are no other vendors' contracts valid for the place of use as indicated 
after the start date of the sales contract. Otherwise, retroactively

the sales contract does not proceed like a normal process, but datahub locks the process and responds 
to the notification of the retroactive sales contract with a negative acknowledgment. 
In this case, the continuation of the processing of the sales contract requires the notification of the seller's manual 
processing in the datahub user interface.  
In the user interface, the seller must enter an explanation of why the contract should start retroactively, and the reason 
handler's contact information for clarifying the situation. After this, the datahub informs the current one 
to the seller the legend and contact information entered by the new seller via email and create for the current seller 
retroactive start approval request to the datahub user interface. The current seller will 
accept retroactive start from the user interface so that the retroactive sales contract can be processed 
continue.  
If the current seller accepts retroactive initiation, the contract process continues as normal 
in accordance with. A negative acknowledgment of the retroactive contract is forwarded upon rejection by the current seller 
to the notified new seller. If the current seller does not accept or reject the retroactive initiation, 
datahub sends a reminder to the current seller after 2 business days and, if necessary, datahub-
the operator contacts the current seller directly. An approved retroactive sales agreement 
after, the contract and balance sheet information of the place of use will be determined based on the new seller's notification below 
is as shown. 
 
IMAGE 343434 CURRENT SELLER ACCEPTS START OF RETROACTIVE AGREEMENT 
If between the start date of the retroactive sales contract and the time of notification, the place of use has 
valid sales contracts of more than one different seller, not the one described above 
procedure can be applied. In this case, the data hub operator will clarify the information of all parties and guide 
these to settle the matter with each other. After the parties have made a decision on the solution of the situation, makes 
datahub operator the necessary changes to the datahub.  
The following diagram describes the process of processing a retroactive new sales contract.

FIGURE 353535 PROCESS OF A RETROSPECTIVE NEW SALE AGREEMENT 
Retroactive terminations of contracts are mainly made at the beginning of the retroactive contract 
in connection with which the announced new contract automatically terminates the previous sales contract. 
Market parties cannot separately notify retroactive contract terminations (DH-330 
events) other than in meter removal situations. If there is a need to do so due to an error situation 
retroactive termination of the contract, the party must contact the datahub operator, who can 
to retroactively terminate the contract. The operator's processes are described in more detail in the chapter 
3.14. 
In addition to the cases presented above, there may be situations where there is a need to retroactively change earlier 
start or end dates of the announced contract. In these situations, the procedures described above are followed 
principles. The start and end dates of the contracts cannot be changed in the contract information 
with an update event to datahub, but in this case you always have to send the previous notification first 
cancellation and then a new notification with a corrected date. If the current seller is in the past 
notified datahub of the termination, can correct this termination date by notifying a new one 
end date with a new end notice. In this case, the earlier one notified to the contract 
the end date is replaced by the end date of the new announcement.  
The repair procedures mentioned above should only be used in error situations. Retroactive changes 
actions are monitored and possible abuses are dealt with. If the situation requires itemployment 
recording balance sheet information in a way other than described above, the market participants should contact each other 
to the datahub operator, who makes the necessary changes based on a written request. If new 
in case of repairs, the contract is notified retroactively to datahub, datahub is not notified 
measurement data belonging to this retroactive period automatically. Notified by the agreement 
the seller receives the measurement data from the data hub with the measurement data search event.

3.2.6 
Other contract types 
Datahub will not maintain the background contract models currently in use on the market. 
When such a background contract is activated in the parties' own systems, these will be announced 
as a notification of a new contract in accordance with datahub's contract processes.  
3.2.6.1 
Small production purchase agreements 
For small-scale production sites, a separate use place will be created in the data hub in accordance with current practice and 
start their own separate processes. Small production contracts are treated the same as 
traditional contracts for places of consumption, i.e. there are no differences in the contract processes between small-scale production and 
between consumption locations. As a purchase contract or online service contract for small production 
in datahub, such an agreement is interpreted that is attached to the production location. 
If a production location and a consumption location are combined with a consumption location 
the sales contract is terminated with the reason "emigration", this information is forwarded in addition to the distribution system operator 
also to the seller of the purchase agreement. Combining consumption and production locations makes it possible 
also that when entering into a new contract, the seller is informed by a pre-inquiry about the place of use that 
the location of use is associated with the location of production use. 
3.2.6.2 
Electricity supply contracts 
Electricity supply contracts do not set special requirements for the data hub. In Datahub 
electricity supply contracts are treated as separate sales and network contracts. However, only 
the seller responsible for delivery assigned to the measurement area can notify the electricity supply contract. 
The seller must inform datahub that it is an electricity supply contract, so that 
the distribution system operator knows not to send the contract confirmation of the network contract to the customer when 
receive information about a new contract from datahub. Similarly, when the electricity supply contract 
are converted into separate contracts, the distribution system operator knows based on the same information as the customer 
a separate online contract confirmation must be sent. Information about the electricity supply contract can be 
also used to find out the number and relative share of such contracts. 
The seller who is obligated to deliver has the right to receive information as to whether the customer is covered by the obligation to deliver 
or not in accordance with the delivery obligation limit of Section 21 of the Electricity Market Act. In addition, with a delivery obligation 
the seller has the right to receive information about how much other sellers have in total as energy sum information 
of customers covered by the delivery obligation in the area. Datahub will provide this information 
with a report offered to the seller obliged to deliver via the datahub user interface.

DH-200 Measurement data processing 
3.3.1 
Measurement data 
 
FIGURE 363636 CLASS DIAGRAM OF MEASUREMENT DATA 
The figure above shows the data structure of the measurement data. Datahub has three types 
measurement points: places of use, border points and production units (NBS's Production Unit / PU). 
All measurement points are associated with measurement data, but the same measurement time series can only be associated with one 
to the measurement point. All measurement points can also be notified of reactive electricity input and output measurements. 
The place of use cannot have two used for invoicing and balance settlement (reactive power) 
measurement time series. Thus, for example, in items where the consumption of the place of use is formed 
from several measurement time series, only one (sum) time series is reported to the data hub. 
Limit points can have one to four measurement time series, depending on whether electricity can be transferred 
at the border point in both directions and whether the reactive electricity measurement data of the border point is also transmitted. 
Information about which direction electricity can move or whether electricity can move must be assigned to the limit point 
in both directions. Self-use of the production unit is reported to the created for this purpose 
for a consumption site whose subtype is the production unit's own use. For everyone 
a so-called measurement responsibilitythe area that is meant to be in question 
the measurement area managed by the network operator responsible for measuring the border point. Responsible for measurement 
the distribution system operator informs the border point of the energy transferred in different directions (from the area responsible for measurement 
to the parallel area and vice versa) separately with two different active energy measurement time series, and

if necessary, with two parasitic negativity measurement time series. The measurement data does not deal with readings but rather 
all measurement data must be converted to time step energy (=hourly average power for hourly measurement). 
Datahub can be notified and measurement values ​​can be retrieved from the datahub in the desired unit (Wh, kWh, 
MWh, GWh or varh, kvarh, Mvarh, Gvarh). Measurement data can be delivered to a maximum of 1 Wh 
give or take. For places of use with a fuse size or equivalent electric power of no more than 3x63 A, 
it is recommended to provide measurement data with an accuracy of 1 Wh, the minimum requirement is 10 Wh. 
For applications where the fuse size or the equivalent electric power is greater than 3x63 A, 
the minimum requirement for the accuracy of measurement data is 1 kWh. Reporting of measurement data will 
take into account the above-described accuracies in the number of decimal places in the measurement values. Kilowatt hours 
(kWh), for example, should be reported with at least two and no more than three decimal places at the most 
For 3x63 A applications. When searching for measurement data, you must state in which unit you want the data 
seek.  
The distribution system operator must report the measurement data in the respective statutory and balance sheet 
with the time step used. The Finnish retail market is moving from an hourly measurement to a 15-minute measurement 
to measurement (arm measurement) during the transition period from 1 January 2023 and in the Nordic countries 
from an hourly balance statement to a 15-minute balance statement (quarter balance) from 22 May 2023. Because of this 
datahub will have support for different time steps of measurement data (for example, 15 minutes and 1 
hour). However, measurement data can always be retrieved from the data hub at the desired time step (for example 
15 minutes, hour, month). Datahub returns the measurement data with the time step with which 
the distribution system operator has reported the measurement data to the data hub, if no time has been specified for the search
step. 
Datahub supports the audit-trail function, which means that all changes made to measurement data are saved 
to historical data. 
In the notification of measurement data, the distribution system operator must indicate the time stamp of the measurement data, 
measurement value and measurement data status. In addition to these, datahub maintains the editing time, 
editor and time of receipt information. The editing time is determined based on the time, 
in which case the datahub saves the information in the database. With the editor information, datahub maintains information about which 
process or which user has edited the measurement data at the time of editing. As a rule 
only the distribution system operator can update the measurement data with measurement data notifications. Measurement data 
modified by the datahub operator only at the request of operators in special cases 
in error situations and changed information is forwarded to the parties entitled to the information. Datahub registers 
also separately the recording time of the measurement data, based on which accurate authentication can be done 
afterwards also the moment when the datahub has received the notification of the measurement data. 
Only positive values ​​are processed in Datahub, so for example consumptions and productions 
must always be reported separately. Measurement data is processed according to Finnish official time. Thus 
in connection with clock changes, the length of the day is either 23 or 25 hours.

3.3.2 
DH-210 Notification of measurement data 
The principle is that only new and changed measurement data should be reported to the data hub. 
It is not necessary to report measurement data for entire days. Datahub transmits the measurement data from the same 
for the time period than it has received it. Status is also interpreted as a change in measurement data 
change, even if the measured value remains the same.  
Reporting data to the data hub is generally the responsibility of the person responsible for the measurement of the measurement point. 
Regarding the places of use, the person responsible for measurement is the distribution network operator. The measuring person deviates 
often from the distribution network operator, e.g. for border points, in which case the person in charge of measurement can be 
for example, the network operator. 
3.3.2.1 
Time limits for notification of measurement data 
Time limits measuredfor the notification of rights in the data hub are determined by the message traffic regulation [1] 
in accordance with. Currently, the time limits are defined in this document for the current view 
according to how the time limits will be recorded in the regulation. It should be noted that the datahub 
implementation requires changes to national legislation and the time limits for the balance sheet are yet to be determined 
in this context, to check and, if necessary, update. Weekdays and weekends not separately 
to be taken into account in the time limits of the data hub, which corresponds to the Nordic balance sheet practice. 
Preliminary measurement data for the previous day must be reported to Datahub for the current day 
by midnight. In accordance with the schedule of the upcoming balance sheet of the distribution system operator 
the final measurement data must be reported to datahub by 24:00 on the delivery date 11 days ago 
(EET/EEST) by, after which the balance window for that delivery date closes. 
The next 24 hours will be reserved for Datahub to perform the balance sheet calculations and the data 
for delivery to eSett. In this time, the datahub processes and validates the measurement data, executes 
you calculate and deliver the data to eSett. Enough time should be reserved for these activities so that 
the time limits of the balance sheet can be observed in all situations.

3.3.2.2 
Validation of measurement data 
The responsibility for validating the measurement data and sending the correct measurement data to the data hub is 
with the person in charge of measurement. Datahub performs simple validations for measurement data in those situations 
for which the distribution system operator's validation is not at a sufficient level. Most notably the data hub 
the validation performed by is validation of statuses, the rules of which are described in section 3.3.2.3.  
Datahub performs validation of negative and excessive values ​​depending on the measurement point 
of type. The value is determined to be excessive if the value exceeds ten times the value declared at the place of use 
electric power. Similarly, production capacity is used as a reference value for production units. If 
the electric power of the place of use has not been reported to the datahub, the fuse size must be reported. In this case, datahub 
calculates the electrical power of the place of use from the indicated fuse size.  
Measurement data can be sent with an accuracy of at most 1 Wh, and datahub validates what is allowed 
the number of decimal places depending on the unit used. For example, information can be reported in the kWh unit 
with a maximum of three decimal places.  
Measurement time series data rejected during validation are not stored in the database, but are returned from them 
time series-specific rejection data. The table below lists those performed by datahub 
validations by measurement type.

Status processing 
The table below shows the statuses used in the data hub from weakest to strongest 
and time limits, in which time the status must be replaced with a stronger status. There is in status processing 
taken into account the Energy Industry's guidelines on the status processing of measurement data [2]. 
TABLE 131313 MEASUREMENT STATUS USED IN THE DATA HUB 
Status 
Definition 
Permitted Substitutes 
statuses 
Missing 
Used if information has not been received from the meter and preliminary information is transmitted 
as zero use. Information marked with missing status must always be replaced 
Within 5 days with a stronger status. 
(If necessary) 
Missing, Uncertain, 
estimated, OK or 
Corrected OK 
Uncertain 
Used when it can be assumed that the information can be refined later 
or change.Most typically, Uncertain status is used when 
the missing measurement data has to be estimated, but it is assumed that 
the measured information will be obtained later. Marked with Uncertain status 
as a rule, the information must be replaced by a stronger status before 
closing of the balance window5. 
Also used for reading measurement profiles when the profile is 
calculated based on the annual usage estimate. 
Uncertain, Estimated, 
OK or Corrected OK 
Estimated 
It is used when the measurement data has to be evaluated and it is known that 
measured or more precise information will not be obtained later either. 
Estimated, (If applicable) 
OK or Corrected OK 
ALRIGHT 
Used for measurement data received from the meter, if not specified 
reason to assume that the value obtained from the meter is incorrect. 
Also used to profile reading measurements when the time series is 
calculated from odometer readings. 
(If necessary) OK, 
(If needed) Fixed 
ALRIGHT 
Corrected OK 
Used when previously transmitted with OK or Assessed status 
however, the measurement data has to be corrected. 
The value can be changed, 
but you don't get the status 
switch to a weaker one 
 
The measurement data status can be replaced with an equally strong or stronger status. Datahub does not reject 
measurement data if the status does not comply with the time limits mentioned above. However, Datahub refuses 
measurement data, if an attempt is made to replace the measurement data contrary to the permitted replacement statuses. 
Monitoring is built into Datahub, which repeatedly deviates from the rules presented above 
market participants can be identified and activities can be intervened. 
In sum calculations, such as the calculation of the seller's measured sum delivery, the sum time series 
status is determined according to the time step in the summation of the time series used for the calculation 
according to the weakest status. 
 
5 In exceptional situations, the status may remain uncertain even after the closing of the balance window [3]

3.3.2.4 
Control of the notification of measurement data 
Datahub sends reminders to the distribution system operator or the person responsible for the measurement data, if 
the distribution system operator has commissioned this to a 3rd party. Reminders will be sent if above 
the described notification time limits and status handling instructions are not followed. Reminders are sent 
in the event that 
• 
preliminary measurement data for the delivery day (previous day) is not available at the turn of the day 
by at all announced 
• 
Information with missing status has been left unassessed 5 days after delivery or 
• 
after closing the balance window, measurement data with uncertain statuses have remained. 
In the first two cases, reminders are sent once a day until 
measurement data has been corrected or delivered, however for a maximum of 30 days. In the last one 
in this case, the reminder will only go out once, because in some situations it is necessary to leave the uncertain status 
effective also after the closing of the balance sheet settlement window. Uncertain statuses will not be sent, however 
reminders regarding reading measurement items. 
Reminders are sent only after the time limit in question has already been exceeded. In the industry 
should generally be trusted that the distribution system operators follow the agreed rules and build 
the necessary processing for this purpose to their own systems. The purpose of reminders is to point out that 
the rules are not followed. If the distribution system operator does not change based on repeated reminders 
operating methods, we will take a closer look at this operation. Reminders are sent 
only for valid measuring points and places of use to the extent that the place of use 
the online contract is valid. 
In the user interface provided by the datahub, the representatives of the distribution system operators must determine whether they can 
electricity to move at that limit point only in one direction or both. Limit point measurements 
regarding the delivery of measurement data is monitored separately for both transmission directions. If to the limit point 
reporting measurement data for the "wrong" direction, the distribution system operator will be informed of this. 
In addition to the previous reminders, the distribution network operators will be notified if there is an outage 
non-zero values ​​are reported for the place of use. In these cases, the distribution system operator 
the reason for non-zero values ​​must be found and either the measurement data or the state of the place of use must be corrected. 
Reminders are sent once a day until the information is corrected, but no more than 30 
for a day. 
3.3.2.5 
Transmission of measurement data 
All measurement data received by Datahub is automatically forwarded to all parties who 
are entitled to this information. If the distribution system operator has commissioned measurement data 
to the service provider of the notification, the measurement data reported by this can be forwarded 
distribution network operatorunder. Datahub transmits measurement data to one system for each party. If 
the party needs data in several of its own systems, the party provides the measurement data itself

sharing between their systems. If the party does not need automatic information for some reason 
transmission in their own operation, the party can switch on data transmission from the datahub user interface 
off. In this case, the party can use a separate measurement data search transaction (DH-220).  
In the transmission message of the measurement data, information is given as to when the transmitted time series data was saved 
to datahub. Based on this information, the recipient can conclude whether the measurement data in question is 
included in the balance sheets when the measurement data is reported very close to the balance sheet window 
closure. The measurement data is always transmitted with the same time step with which it was delivered 
to datahub. 
3.3.3 
Handling reading measurements and unmeasured items 
Datahub does not receive or process the readings of reading measurements. The distribution system operator must calculate or 
otherwise, prepare profiles of reading measurements per place of use and report these to the data hub. 
Profiles in Datahub should be created according to the type of user group shown in the current measurement setting 
1 according to the comparison curve. This procedure requires changes to the content of the measurement regulation. 
The profile is created based on the annual usage estimate of the place of use. Currently for type user group 2 
from the use of the calculated so-called balance energy forecast and the associated temperature correction 
we will give up on this. 
Profiles calculated on the basis of the distribution system operator's annual usage estimate are reported to the data hub 
with a status of "Uncertain". The profiles are reported with the status "OK" when the distribution system operator reads 
readings from the meter and based on this, calculates a corrected profile up to the moment of the previous reading. Thus 
the same status rules apply to reading measurements as to other measurements. If the distribution system operator 
corrects the profile indicated with the status "OK", the corrected measurement data must be indicated with the status 
"Fixed-OK". 
There are places of use that do not have energy metering. These are generally used as designations 
unmetered place of use and constant power object. Also for these places of use by the distribution network operator 
measurement data must be reported in time series format. The distribution system operator can prepare an unmetered schedule 
of the profile of the place of use in the desired way, such as by announcing the same energy to each time-
step or by using the comparison curve of type user group 1 mentioned above. Unmeasured 
the status "Evaluated" is used for the measurement data of the place of use, and corrections are made with the status 
"Fixed-OK". 
Profiles and standard power time series of reading measurement objects are reported to the data hub in the same way and 
with the same time limits and validations as other measurement data.  
3.3.4 
Measurement data corrections 
The distribution system operator must correct incorrect measurement data in the data hub for the entire period for which 
measurement data is stored in the data hub (6 years). Corrected measurement data is forwarded to everyone 
to parties entitled to measurement data in accordance with these rights. With this, the parties 
can receive corrected measurement data for the entire time the measurement data is stored in the data hub.

The correction of the measurement data may involve the correction of the customer's invoicing, if there is already a customer 
billed based on incorrect information. In these situations, ET guidelines [3] and 
also in the future, the instruction will be applied in the data hub so that the correction of the measurement data is reported 
to datahub when the customer has been informed or an agreement has been reached with the customer 
about correcting measurement data. Thus, the repair invoicing of the customer's sales contract is performed by 
regarding changes in measurement data, those sellers who have corrections of measurement errors on the date of notification 
valid or no more than six weeks ago from the notification date of the measurement data correction 
expired contract at the place of use whose measurement data is corrected. For the seller, the contract 
exchange, i.e. a new contract made by the current seller of a place of use, where at least one 
the customer remains the same, does not terminate the liability for invoicing. This is described in more detail below 
in the picture. 
 
FIGURE 383838 PROCESSING OF CONTRACT EXCHANGE IN INVOICING REPAIR RESPONSIBILITY 
MEASUREMENT DATANOT IN REPAIR SITUATION 
The distribution system operator is always responsible for correcting the invoicing of its own online service and 
sales contracts that ended more than six weeks ago from the notification date of the measurement data correction 
about correcting the invoicing (correction of the contract for customers B and C in the picture above). 
Corrections of measurement data are also taken into account in the correction of balance errors, so that a balance error 
is always recorded for the effective period of the measurement error, when the sales contract is invoiced 
repair is the seller's responsibility. 
3.3.5 
Processing of parasitic data 
Datahub allows reactive power to be taken from the network - (inductive) and input to the network - (capacitive) 
reporting and searching measurement data for places of use, production units and border points. Parasite electricity 
datahub only acts as an information broker. Therefore, based on the reactive electricity measurement data, no 
calculations are performed in the datahub and data reporting is not monitored. For static electricity measurement data 
only status processing and validation of negative values ​​are carried out, because taking from the network and 
submission to the network must be reported in its own time series. Intermittent power data is not automatically transmitted 
to the seller. An information field is added to the place of use, which says that the place of use is available 
parasitic data. Based on this information, the seller can, if he wishes, order reactive electricity measurement data

from the datahub user interface of the agency. The information "Intermittent electricity data available" is updated by datahub 
according to whether the distribution system operator has reported new parasitic measurement data within a month. 
3.3.6 
Processing of cut-off point and production unit measurements 
The measurement data of border points and production units is needed in the data hub of the distribution system operator 
to calculate the balance sheet. These measurement data are reported like other measurement data and 
measurement data can also be corrected outside the balance window. Border points and production units 
regarding corrections of measurement data, however, balance errors are not recorded, but possible monetary ones 
corrections are carried out for these directly between the party obliged to measure and this 
between the counterparty (another network operator) one-on-one. 
Corresponding switching status information is used at border points and production units, as at places of use 
is used. Through the user interface, the network company can temporarily remove the border point or 
from the use of the production unit by changing the connection status to the 'under construction' status. Not in this case either 
measurement data must be delivered to these measurement points. 
Reporting the boundary point measurement data to the data hub is the responsibility of the person in charge of the measurement point. 
Thus, for example, the national grid company and regional grid companies must also notify 
border point measurement data to the extent that the balance statement of the second measurement area of ​​the border point is processed 
in datahub. Validation and processing of measurements of limit points and production units is the responsibility of others 
the processing of measurement data as applicable. 
3.3.7 
Netting calculations 
Datahub performs the netting calculation always in connection with the measurement data notification of the distribution system operator. 
The netting of the place of use refers to the interconnected consumption and (small) production places of use 
netting of measurement data within a time step (hour or 15 minutes). In this case, consumption and 
the difference in production (more precisely, its absolute value) is recorded either for consumption or production 
whichever is greater. Parasitic energy is not netted. The table below shows 
example of netting for the first four hours of the day (in the case of hourly measurement).

The netting calculation is based on the data hub's information model on the parallel usage location information 
and to information on the maximum power of the production device of the small production site. The netting calculation is performed 
whenever the parallel usage location information is valid, there is one or more small production usage locations 
production device and the total sum of the maximum output of the production devices is no more than 100 kVA 
(if the conditions for the netting calculation are met, the information "Netting calculation" is stored in the usage location). 
If the total power is more than 100 kVA or the production device has not been declared or the production lawfrom tea 
maximum power information is missing, the place of use is not included in the netting calculation. 
The maximum power of the production device of the small-scale production location is converted in the processing of the data hub 
from the indicated units W, kW, MW, GW directly into units VA, kVA, MVA, GVA. Provided 
the distribution system operator knows of cases where the conversion is not directly available, will 
the distribution system operator changes the power data so that the maximum power is correct after the conversion. 
When the maximum power of the production device changes so that the place of use should either be in the future 
included in the netting calculations or removed from the netting calculations, the distribution system operator must do this 
in connection with the maximum power change, first remove the parallel usage location information from the data hub and 
add the parallel usage location information again after the change. This is how you get the changes 
in relation to the calculations. 
The performance of the calculation does not depend on other information, such as the conditions of the place of use or contracts. 
If one of the pair of usage locations included in the calculation is in "under construction" mode, for that one 
no measurement data is expected for the place of use. The calculation is also performed for both in this case 
for places of use, but the calculation is only made of the measurement data delivered to another place of use 
by. 
The time step of the netting calculation results depends on the time step used in the balance sheet. 
The balance sheet will be carried out with an hourly accuracy until May 2023, when the transition will take place 
in the balance sheet to a 15-minute time step.  
1) When the hourly balance statement is valid, the netting is calculated for the time of the place of use
according to the step. In this case, if hourly metering is valid at the place of use, they are 
netted results at hourly level. Correspondingly, those measured in a 15-minute period 
the netted values ​​of the places of use are calculated with an accuracy of 15 minutes and 
mediated. The distribution system operator of the consumption and production site must ensure, 
that the time step of both places of use corresponds to each other.  
a. Datahub always calculates the netting values ​​for the time of the point of use to be netted
according to the step. Thus, if the time step of the point of consumption is 
for example, an hour and 15 minutes for a production location, calculated by datahub 
the netted values ​​of the place of consumption also with an hourly accuracy and 
the netted values ​​of the production site with an accuracy of 15 minutes. 
Hourly data is divided by four in the netting calculation (see 
example below).  
2) When the balance statement changes to an accuracy of 15 minutes, datahub will calculate 
also the results of the netting always with 15-minute accuracy regardless 
about the measurement accuracy/time step of the places of use.

The table below shows an example of the netting calculation for one hour in a situation, 
where the consumption location is hourly measured and the production location has a 15-minute measurement period. 
First, the measured consumption is divided by four by the data hub into 15-minute readings. Next 
the netting is done with an accuracy of 15 minutes and finally the hourly net consumption is obtained by adding 15 
net consumption per minute.

Market parties must use the netted values ​​of the place of use when invoicing the customer. 
The exception is, however, the situation where the places of use belong to the energy community (see chapter 3.3.8). 
Datahub maintains separate information on which time series of the usage location (measured energy, 
netted energy or community energy) at any given time is the so-called billable information. However, this information is not 
is stored as part of the location data, but the information is notified to the parties as part of DH-211, DH-231 and 
DH-251 forwarding messages in the data field "Information used in billing". If the distribution system operator 
reports measurement data for the time interval within which the above said information changes, becomes datahub 
to split the relay messages into two messages on both sides of the moment of change. Datahub uses 
this information also in the balance sheet calculations (i.e. only the billable time series of the place of use is taken 
into account).  
Datahub forwards the calculated netting information at the end of the calculation to all parties entitled to the information 
(for distribution system operators, sellers and third parties). Market participants can also apply 
netting information separately with search events. You can only apply at the application event if necessary 
netted time series used in billing. 
The netting calculation is also performed if both are not included in the measurement data declaration 
measurement data of places of use. In this case, the status of the calculated data is partially missing, unlessi 
the necessary measurement data has not been reported to the datahub before. 
3.3.8 
Energy community calculations 
Similarly to the netted data, datahub calculates the community energies of the distribution system operator 
in connection with the measurement data notification. As a result, the energy community calculation calculates the consumption
/the so-called of the production use place community energy. Community energy generally refers to the place of use 
consumption or production, from which the share of the place of use has been deducted/added to the community 
from production (depending on whether it is a place of consumption or production use). The energy community can 
specify two different sharing methods: SMA or SMB.

The energy community's calculations are affected by the following information: 
• 
Community-assigned surplus allocation method (SMA/SMB) 
• 
the distribution share (in percentages) of the community determined for the place of consumption 
of total production 
• 
switching mode of the consumption point 
• 
netting applicable to the place of use (based on the parallel place of use information) 
Energy community calculations are performed like netting calculations within a time step (hourly/15 
to the minute). The following general principles apply to calculations: 
• 
The internal netting of the place of use is always calculated before the community calculation 
o The consumption of the netted place of use is deducted in full 
production of a parallel production site 
o Possible production surplus after netting of the site of use 
will be transferred as part of the energy community's distributed total production 
o Note this netting principle is also applied in a situation where 
the production location to be netted is assigned to the energy community 
surplus production use place 
• 
The total production of the energy community is calculated by everyone connected to the community 
production of production locations, incl. possible places of parallel use 
productions reduced in netting (see previous section) 
• 
About the consumption of the (connected) consumption point belonging to the energy community 
the percentage of the community determined for the place of use is deducted 
of total production (share) 
• 
The consumption of the disconnected point of use is not deducted for the point of use 
part of the total production of the community, but share is recorded 
into the community's surplus energy 
• 
The results are calculated with the accuracy of the time step of the measurement of the place of use, or 15 
after the introduction of the one-minute balance sheet with an accuracy of 15 minutes 
respectively, as in netting (see chapter 3.3.7). 
Datahub transmits the calculated community energies at the end of the calculation to all those entitled to the information 
parties (distribution system operators, sellers and 3rd parties). Saying tells 
depending on the place of use, whether the time series in question is a time series used in billing or not. 
Market participants can also search for community energy data separately with search events.

If necessary, only those used in invoicing can be applied for in the application process 
energy community time series. 
The calculation is also carried out if the measurement data declaration does not include all members of the community 
measurement data of places of use. In this case, the status of the calculated data is partially missing, if not 
the required measurement data has not been reported to the datahub before. If the place of use belongs to the community 
is in the "under construction" mode, no measurement data is expected for the respective usage location. The calculation is performed 
also in this case for all community locations, but the calculation is made only for the community 
based on the measurement data delivered to other places of use. 
3.3.8.1 
Distribution method SMA 
In the SMA distribution method, the surplus energy is recorded in its entirety to the energy community defined 
for (one) production site. 
In addition to the general principles presented above, the following rules are followed in the calculation: 
• 
All surplus energy is recorded for the community defined surplus energy 
to the production site 
o Possible distribution of the consumption place of use and the place of use 
the difference in consumption (production share > consumption) is transferred to surplus energy 
• 
A production site that may belong to the community, which does not belong to the community 
determined surplus energy production location, production (net or 
measured) is transferred in its entirety as part of the shareable by the community 
total production. 
Community energies are thus calculated for different types of places of use as follows:

In the table, netted consumption/production means netting (between two consumption sites) based on a parallel usage site. 
The result of the calculation for a usage site is always 0 or greater (no negative values). 
*In a disconnected usage site, consumption should generally be zero, but in exceptional cases, values ​​other than zero may occur. 
3.3.8.2 
SMB distribution method 
In the SMB distribution method, the community's total production is distributed to all consumption sites belonging to the energy community according to these distribution shares. Any surpluses specific to the consumption site are recorded in the parallel production site of the consumption site. In this distribution method, 
the community's surplus energy is only formed for disconnected consumption points. 
The rules for parallel consumption points described below also apply to the so-called virtual consumption point. 
In other words, the normal production point and the virtual production point are treated in the calculations with the same rules. 
The following special rules apply to the calculations of the SMB distribution method: 
• 
The total production of the community is distributed to all consumption points belonging to the energy community in accordance with these percentage distribution shares 
o The share exceeding the consumption of the consumption point (measured or netted) 
is calculated for the parallel production point of the consumption point in question 
o If the consumption point does not have a parallel production point, 
the distribution system operator must establish a so-called virtual 
utility (see chapter 3.1.4) 
• 
The share of the disconnected consumption point is transferred to the 
surplus energy production point assigned to the community 
Community energies are thus calculated for different types of consumption points as follows:

DH-400 Connection and disconnection processes 
3.4.1 
Overview 
From Datahub's perspective, connections and disconnections are changes in the status of the usage point, which are 
reported separately in connection with the contract processes and during delivery in connection with the parties' 
collection processes or modification work performed at the usage point.in. Datahub forwards the seller's requests 
to the distribution system operator about the change in status of the place of use, as well as information about the change in status 
from the distribution system operator to the seller. 
The time limits for connecting and disconnecting requests are determined by which part of the overall process 
the procedure is performed. When connecting or disconnecting takes place as part of the moving process, not separately 
disconnection or connection request, but the distribution system operator connects or disconnects the point of use 
electricity as needed at the end of the contract processes, when the time limits for information exchange are determined 
in accordance with contract processes. Thus, for example, in situations of moving, the connection to the place of use can 
be possible to receive under certain conditions for the current day (more detailed description in the contract processes). 
The operating model for reconnection is specific to the network company. It is always indicated in the connection request 
the connection's contact person and his/her phone number, so that the distribution system operator can ensure a safe connection 
connection. 
The seller must make cut-off requests related to collection processes no later than a week before 
the desired day. When the customer pays the bill to be collected, one should strive for good customer service 
for the fastest possible reconnection. If the customer pays the invoice before requested 
cut-off date, the cancellation of the cut-off request must be notified with a separate cancellation notice. If 
the customer pays the bill on the requested cut-off date, the seller must inform the place of use 
connection request. This is how it works, because the distribution system operator may not be able to cancel 
disconnection only on the same day when the electricity disconnection is to be carried out. Datahub cares 
the seller's connection request in real time to the distribution network operator, who processes it for the cut-off date 
the incoming connection request according to its own processes. If the distribution system operator still has time to cancel 
based on the connection request made on the day of the disconnection, the distribution system operator must respond 
to the seller's original disconnection request with a disconnection notice, where the status of the place of use is 
specified as "connected". In addition to this, the distribution system operator must respond to the seller's connection request 
respectively. Otherwise, the distribution system operator must notify the performed disconnection 
according to the basic process. The procedure described above ensures that the original 
the disconnection request can be processed to the end in all situations, and the datahub will not be left waiting 
disconnection notice from the distribution system operator, if the disconnection is not carried out.  
The distribution network operator may not connect the point of use before the seller's connection request, if there is a disconnection 
made accordingly at the seller's request. If the seller needs to inform the distribution system operator that 
electricity in a place of use that is already switched off must not be switched on, the seller must also 
in this case indicates a request to disconnect the access point. The distribution system operator must respond to this request 
with a new cut-off notice for the actual cut-off date, even if it is for your own needs 
already notified the datahub of the completed disconnection.

When the distribution system operator's connection or disconnection notice is used to change the one under construction 
connected or disconnected as the status of the point of use, the distribution system operator must first remember to update 
the property information for the respective location of use, if it was previously missing. Datahub does not allow 
connection or disconnection of the place of use, if any mandatory information about the characteristics of the place of use 
is missing. 
By default, the distribution system operator reports the connection or disconnection as soon as the information is available 
available in the distribution system operator's own system, i.e. like any other 
updating the location information. In the case of an item where connection or disconnection is performed 
manually, can update the information to the system of the distribution network and through it to the data hub 
a delay that is allowed to be a maximum of one week. Delays of more than a week for connection and disconnection requests 
answering will be monitored by the datahub operator. Cut-off and 
connection requests are not validated based on status information in the datahub, as it may be from here 
due to the delay, your current one is incorrect. The seller can always send connection or disconnection requests 
according to datahub status information. The distribution system operator has the correct status information, when 
the distribution system operator is able to process the seller's requests correctly in its own processes. 
As an example of the method of operation, a situation where the seller has first requested disconnection due to debt collection, and 
the distribution system operator will manually cut off the electricity at the point of use on the morning of the request day. Customer 
informs the seller that he has paid the bill as soon as the electricity goes out, but the seller cannot see the data hub 
proper state of place of use because verseThe distribution network operator does not yet have the information in its own system due to a manual disconnection. Even if the point of use is currently connected in Datahub, the seller can 
send a connection request to Datahub, which the distribution network operator can forward to the installer. 
If the distribution network operator is unable or unwilling to connect the point of use in accordance with the seller's request, 
the distribution network operator will notify this with a connection delay event no later than the weekday following the requested 
connection or disconnection date. Delays longer than this in responding to requests will be monitored by the datahub operator. The event explanation can 
provide the reason why the connection cannot be made. If necessary, this delay notification can be notified 
several times. If the distribution network operator is unable to implement the requested disconnection on the date requested by the seller, the electricity delivered to the point of use must be included in the distribution network operator's 
balance. The distribution system operator must notify the seller of this delay via datahub. 
If necessary, the seller can request connection on a new day. The previous connection request is cancelled based on the new request. The electricity supply at the point of use is again included in the seller's balance from the moment the distribution system operator connects the electricity to the point of use based on the seller's connection request. However, if the connection is reported late outside the balance window for one reason or another, the electricity consumed at the point of use may be included in the losses of the metering area for the period outside the balance window. The distribution system operator may not always be able to estimate the correct day for connection or disconnection. If necessary, the distribution system operator may report a delay in connection or disconnection several times using the same event. 
The distribution system operator usually charges a fee for connections and disconnections performed on a short schedule, outside working hours or without remote connection. In these 
cases, the distribution system operator invoices the seller or the customer, depending on which party has requested the connection or disconnection. 
The distribution system operators' price lists have been compiled in a standard table on the datahub 
service portal so that the seller can easily provide additional information on the costs of connections and disconnections

to the customer. These situations are most often related to moving processes where the move-in takes place on a 
fast schedule. With the support of the distribution system operator's price list, it is easier to agree with the customer on the 
start date of the contract, and to inform the customer about any costs caused by the fast schedule. 
During the delivery, the customer may also need to have the electricity disconnected or connected to their point of use, 
for example, in renovation situations. In these cases, the customer must contact the 
distribution system operator. If the distribution system operator is dismantling the point of use, it may be necessary to notify the 
distribution system operator of the electricity disconnection at the point of use before notifying the actual dismantling. Once the disconnection has been 
reported, the distribution system operator can then report the status of the point of use as deactivated 
by reporting it with a point of use data update event. 
In situations where the disconnection of a point of use also leads to the disconnection of a 
production point of use located in the same physical location, the distribution system operator must notify both points of use of the disconnection. 
The seller can cancel the connection request it has reported with its own cancellation event.

DH-500 Distribution System Operator's Imbalance Settlement 
This chapterthe distribution system operator's balance sheet calculations performed in the vataa data hub as well as 
notifications of balance sheet information to eSett and the parties. After commissioning, datahub handles 
balance settlement reporting to eSett on behalf of the distribution system operator with regard to all data. Ad hoc 
a user interface is also created for datahub, so-called for the maintenance of structural data in respect of those data, 
for which there are no separate messaging processes. Datahub forwards to the distribution system operator 
information about the balance deviations of the measurement areas calculated by eSett and the confirmed limit point sums.  
The distribution system operator is responsible for the calculations of the balance settlement information described in this chapter 
reporting data to datahub in accordance with the agreed rules and time limits. Datahub 
is responsible for performing the balance sheet calculations and forwarding these to eSett in the Nordics 
following the rules of the balance sheet settlement model (NBS). The rules of the NBS model are described in eSett 
in the manual published by [4]. From Datahub, balance sheet information can also be searched for this information 
by authorized parties.  
The diagram below shows the daily balance settlement process, with the most important tasks 
are performing balance sheet calculations based on structural data and measurement data and 
information exchange of balance sheet information. Balance sheet calculations depend on DH-120, DH-200, DH-300 and DH-
400 processes and maintaining the structural information of the balance sheet through the user interface. 
The information to be processed in the balance sheet and exchanged between the parties is described in more detail 
later in this chapter.

3.5.1 
Initial data for the balance sheet 
Balance sheet data consists of structural data and measurement/time series data. Structurally 
the information is used to manage which party's balance sheet and which measurement area each measurement point is used for 
measurement data (measured consumption or production) are calculated by the data hub 
in balance sheet calculations. 
According to the Nordic balance sheet model, the distribution system operator's balance sheet is calculated 
by measurement area. Distribution system operators can divide their networks into one or more 
to the measurement range. Mainly, however, distribution system operators only have one measurement area. Below 
the figure below shows the information based on the balance sheet calculations in the data hub 
is performed. The responsibility for maintaining this information rests with the distribution system operator for sales contract information 
except. Technically, however, the data hub operator will manage the measurement areas 
data because this data has a significant and wide-ranging impact on other datahub data and 
processes, including balance sheet calculations and usage location information. In practice, we want to 
ensure that all necessary changes, such as deciding and adding measurement areas, 
is done in a controlled manner, taking into account all perspectives. 
The relations marked in blue are valid. This means that, for example, 
the loss seller of the measurement area may change over time and the system must be able to manage these 
changes in such a way that the History data is preserved. When interpreting the picture, it should be noted that in part 
of these relations, only one relation can be valid at a time, even if it is marked as multiplicity 
"1..*". Exact definitions of relationships can be found in the data standard. Relationships related to balance sheet information 
validity is determined based on the validity of the balance sheet information. It is also discussed in Datahub 
information on market balance areas, even though there is only one market balance area in use in Finland. 
This ensures that the data hub supports the general structure of the electricity market as much as possible 
for future needs.

FIGURE 434343 INFORMATION USED IN THE BALANCE SHEET CALCULATION 
The calculation of the balance sheet is based on measurement points - i.e. places of use, limit points and 
measurement data of production units. The measurement points always belong to one measurement area 
at a time. Jhowever, the system must be prepared for situations where the measurement points move 
from a certain point in time to another measurement area. Such situations may occur, for example 
with the integration or division of measurement areas. There are these situations and their management 
described in more detail in chapter 3.11. Datahub must also have the possibility to maintain information, for what 
the measurement area at any given time belongs to the market balance area, so that the system supports the general 
electricity market structure. 
The distribution system operator maintains the data of the point of use through the point of use maintenance events (DH-120). 
Breakpoint and production unit data are maintained via the datahub user interface and must be created 
via the user interface before reporting the measurement data to the respective measurement points. 
The distribution system operator also maintains information about the seller of the production unit. All measurement points 
measurement information is reported in accordance with event DH-211 measurement information notification. 
The distribution system operator must also maintain information about which sellers are responsible via the user interface

on the roles of open supplier and loss seller of the measurement area (balance deviation) at any given time. Datahub 
through the user interface, the distribution network operators will have access to the report shown in the image above 
of the structural data according to Excluding balance sheet data specific to the place of use. 
The distribution network operator can authorize other parties in the user interface with the assignment of border points and 
to measurement data of production units. Regarding border points, you can only place an order 
distribution system operator responsible for measurement. In this case, the measurement data of these measurement points is transmitted 
automatically to authorized parties. The measurement data of boundary points is transmitted by default 
always also to the distribution network operator of the other measurement area of ​​the border point when both of the border point 
the measurement areas are not under the control of the same distribution system operator. Datahub will have the information 
from the substation and substation field to which the boundary point is connected to facilitate data processing 
in the parties' own processes and in the data hub. 
The measurement data of the places of use are attached to the seller in the so-called balance settlement calculations. with the help of balance sheet information. If 
there is no valid balance sheet information for the site of use, the possible productions of the site of use are calculated or 
consumption from this period to losses in the measurement area, i.e. the so-called to the distribution system operator's balance sheet. 
Basically, the validity of the balance sheet information corresponds to the one announced by the seller at the place of use 
the start and end date of the sales contract. However, the balance sheet information may change 
in cancellations of sales contracts and retroactive repairs, as well as those initiated by the seller 
in disconnection and connection processes. For canceling sales contracts and correcting errors 
related changes in balance sheet information are described in chapter 3.2.5. In situations where the seller asks for the agreed 
within the time limits, disconnection to the place of use, but the distribution network operator does not get it for one reason or another 
electricity is cut off, the consumption/production of the place of use is calculated according to the industry's agreed practice 
to losses in the measurement range. For this reason, the balance sheet responsibility is transferred to the distribution system operator (seller's 
balance sheet information is decided) from the day following the cut-off date indicated in the seller's cut-off request 
of the day. Balance responsibility is transferred back to the seller (a new balance sheet is created) of the distribution system operator 
on the basis of the indicated switching moment. 
3.5.2 
Virtual production units 
Measurement area- and vendor-specific small-scale production, i.e. related to the production-type place of use 
production, is processed in NBS in such a way that a so-called virtual production unit, 
the production of which is calculated as the total small production per measurement area and vendor. Because of this 
the system must have vendor-, measurement area- and NBS-specific virtual 
production unit whenever the seller has balance sheet information for the place of use where the type of place of use is 
"production". In Datahub, virtual production units are managed in such a way that the virtual 
creation of production units, deletion and updates of validity periods do not require separate user 
measures. 
The virtual production unit is treated in the NBS model like any other production unit. Thus 
for the virtual production unit, an ID, name, according to NBS, must be assigned to the system 
type of production and capacity. Capacity maintenance, for example, the power of production equipment 
summing is not meaningful, as this would require calculating a new capacity 
at best daily, so it must be possible to set a certain predefined value as capacity. 
The name of the virtual production unit is generated automatically, for example, the measuring range, vendor

based on the ID and production type. The system generates an ID for the virtual production unit in accordance with the identification system in use. The system updates the validity of the relationship between the virtual 
production unit and the seller so that the relationship is valid 
exactly when the seller has at least one balance data for the usage point in the metering area in question, where the 
production type corresponds to the NBS production type of the virtual 
production unit. This validity can 
consist of one or more time intervals. 
The production type of the virtual 
production unit depends on the type of production devices that have been 
reported to the usage point. NBS production types differ from the production types defined for the production devices in Datahub. 
The cross-tabulation of these production types is presented in the table below. If no production device has been defined for the 
production usage point or if several production devices with different production types have been defined for the 
production usage point, the production type of the virtual 
production unit is defined as "other production". If one or more production devices with the same production type have been reported for a production site, the production type corresponding to the production devices at the site is determined as the NBS production type for the production unit according to the table below.

Imbalance settlement calculations and calculated data 
Datahub calculates imbalance settlement time series (imbalance settlement result time series) based on structural data and 
measurement data until the closing of the balance window. The graph below presents the general structure of the imbalance settlement time series based on the 
NBS model from Datahub's perspective. 
The actual calculated imbalance settlement time series are described later in this chapter (Table

FIGURE 444444 DATA ON IMBALANCE SETTLEMENT CONNECTIONS 
Imbalance settlement time series serve as the basis for the imbalance settlement performed by eSett. In Datahub, the 
balance settlement type determines the purpose of the imbalance settlement time series in the imbalance settlement. 
The imbalance settlement method determines whether the imbalance settlement data is based on measured or otherwise 
determined, i.e. profiled data. In Datahub, profiled measurement data is all 
measurement data that is related to a point of use whose measurement method is readingmeasurement or 
unmetered. It should be noted that the method of measuring the place of use can change in practice 
several times and these changes with validity information must be taken into account 
in balance sheet calculations. For example, consumption is calculated for the seller's profiled sum delivery 
only and only for those periods when the measurement method of the place of use is "reading measurement" or 
"unmeasured". 
Not all combinations of balance settlement method and type are in use. The NBS model allows, for example, both 
measured and profiled (network) losses, although only measured losses are used in Finland. 
Profiled balance sheet information in Finland is only used for sum deliveries and 
for self-use of production units. For places of use, the method of measuring the place of use determines it, 
which balance sheet method is used to calculate the consumption/production of the respective site of use.  
The balance sheet connection is, in principle, the datahub's equivalent to the MEC defined by eSett (Market 
Entity Connection) [4]. Datahub's balance sheet connection is a concept that defines a balance sheet time series 
the related balance settlement method and type and connects the time series to market participants and production data

for a (virtual or real) production unit. Datahub will maintain 
balance sheet connections automatically based on the initial data of the balance sheet (see Figure 4242 Figure 42). 
It should be noted that the same balance settlement type, balance settlement method, seller, measurement area and 
There can be several balance settlement connections with the combination production unit in the data hub, but only 
one at a time valid. The structural information of the balance sheet reported by datahub to eSett 
are mainly based on balance sheet statements. 
The balance statement is made per measurement area and vendor, i.e. for all production and consumption 
always be a salesman. All consumption and production for which a vendor is not specified is counted 
according to the calculation rules, to the losses of the distribution network and the measurement area in question 
to the loss seller's balance sheet. Only the sum level of the measurement area is not related to the balance settlement time series 
seller. These time series are not actually used in the balance sheet and are not reported to eSett, but 
their use is limited to statistics and analysis needs.

Imbalance) and confirmed limit point sums (MGA Exchange confirmation) are calculated in eSett 
in the system. The purpose of balancing is to manage situations where various rounding, 
due to calculation and data exchange errors, the limit point sum of the measurement range does not match 
to the sum of productions in the measurement area, deliveries by sellers and losses in the measurement areas. In these 
the balance deviation calculated in situations is recorded by the open supplier of the balance deviation of the measurement area 
for delivery. The balance deviation is calculated as the sum of calculations 1-7 in the table below, signs 
taking into account. Since the losses of the measurement areas (calculation 7) are calculated as the sum of calculations 1-6, should 
the calculated imbalance should always be zero under normal circumstances. Balance deviation is provided by eSett 
separately for the open balance window of the preliminary balance deviation and the final one 
for the day on which the imbalance closed. 
In accordance with the NBS rules [4], datahub separates the data it reports by vendor and measurement area 
amount information according to the type and method of balance settlement. The table below shows the data hub 
calculated sum calculations used in Finland's balance sheet. 
The information on the blue-gray background is reported to eSett for balance settlement. Measurement areas 
when calculating losses, the principle is that losses are calculated from the data reported to eSett 
based on and not on the basis of sum calculations of measurement areas. Losses are calculated, for example 
on the basis of individual limit point sums instead of the total limit point sum of the measurement area 
to avoid possible rounding errors. Rounding errors could cause unnecessary 
balance deviations in eSett's calculations. 
With the transition to the quarterly balance sheet, Datahub will calculate the total information of the balance sheet every quarter 
with a time step. Regarding hourly measurements, in the balance sheet calculation, the series of hours are first counted as own 
into series of sums. The hourly sum series are then divided by four and added together 
with individual sum sets.

Structural information 
Datahub informs eSett separately of structural data before time series data 
inform. Notifications of structural information are mainly based on those described in section 3.5.3 
to the balance sheet statements. Structural information is reported to eSett at vendor/metering area level and 
for individual measuring points, only the data of the production units are reported. Structural information 
is, for example, which seller operates in a certain measurement area. For example, a new seller 
when registering to datahub, this information is reported to eSett. Technically, also a small production amount 
will deal with the so-called as a virtual production unit and it is created per measurement area 
for each seller separately by type of production. 
For the distribution system operator's balance sheet, datahub informs eSett of the following structural information

Boundary connection refers to information about which two measurement areas transfer occurs, i.e. which 
there is at least one border point between two measurement areas. Regarding the seller operating in the measurement area 
datahub includes the following information in eSett's notification: measurement area, balance settlement type 
(BusinessTypeCode), settlement method (SettlementMethodCode) and validity information. Every 
the seller's balance settlement type/balance settlement method combination must be reported as separate information to eSett 
according to table Table 2222Table 22.

In addition to the above, datahub informs eSett of the production data of individual production units (PU), 
vendor-specific small production sums by measurement area and cut-off point sums between networks. 
For the small production sum of the seller's measurement area, datahub creates a virtual production unit (PU), 
to whom the information is reported. Also to the extent that the calculation of losses in the measurement area produces negative ones 
values, for example due to missing measurement data, datahub will report negative values 
as part of the production of the virtual production unit of the loss seller of the measurement area with the production type "other 
production". This is done because eSett does not allow negative values ​​for consumption (and not for production). Below 
the data exchange documents with which datahub communicates this information to eSett are listed.

Seller's balance sheet information 
Datahub calculates the balance sheet time series data of the seller and the measurement area. The diagram belowin 
the seller's measurement area-specific balance sheet information is presented. New and changed balance sheet information 
the period of the balance sheet window and the last day locked in the balance sheet are reported to the sellers 
daily. In addition to the notification, the seller can retrieve this information separately from datahub. The picture shows the seller 
small-scale production refers to small-scale production by type of production and the total amount of small-scale production 
the sum of all small productions. It should be noted that not every seller necessarily has 
all information. Losses in the measurement area, for example, are reported only to the seller who works 
as a loss seller of the measurement area.

FIGURE 484848 DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OPERATOR'S MEASUREMENT REGION-SPECIFIC BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION 
With the introduction of Datahub, the distribution network operator does not necessarily have information in the current way 
from the seller of the place of use. For this reason, in addition to the actual balance sheet information, data is sent from the hub 
notification to the distribution system operator when the sales contract for the point of use is concluded, in which case 
the distribution network operator knows how to cut off the electricity. Datahub also notifies distribution system operators separately, 
if the places of use have been left without a seller and they have not been notified of termination. In addition to the previous ones 
datahub offers distribution system operators a separate search event, which the distribution system operator can use 
becomes aware of the consumptions/productions calculated by the distribution system operator for each location of use 
to losses.  
3.5.8 
Balance sheet calculations outside the balance sheet window 
Primarily, balance sheet calculations are calculated in the data hub by the official eSett 
for the needs of the balance sheet. However, the results of balance sheet calculations have other uses 
in addition to the official balance sheet. For example, losses in the measurement area are a significant expense item 
for the network company and the exact amount of losses is monitored in the network companies also in the balance sheet window 
outside time. Datahub will be the primary data warehouse for measurement and 
for balance sheet information, so it is natural that all up-to-date and corrected measurement data and about them 
the calculated calculation results are available from datahub for all data. 
The official balance sheet always closes when the balance sheet window closes, and then in the official one 
the information calculated in the balance sheet and reported to eSett can no longer be changed. Balance window

external changes in measurement data are mainly taken into account in the calculation of balance errors. 
However, balance errors are not registered for border points or production units, nor for them 
for places of use where the measurement error affects a sales contract that ended more than 6 weeks ago 
for time. Thus, the update of the results of balance sheet calculations in connection with the calculation of balance sheet errors is not 
not be possible. This applies not only to losses in measurement areas but also to other balance sheets 
sum calculations. 
For the period outside the balance window, everything corresponding to the official balance sheet will be calculated 
calculation results once a month for the last 3 years for all measurement areas. These results 
are searchable using DH-520 data search events. In the search event, the party will 
indicates whether the party is seeking information locked in the official balance sheet or the information described above 
results of correction calculations. In addition to the monthly calculation, correction calculations can be done 
if requested, perform separately for a freely specified time.

DH-600 Handling of balance errors 
Handling of balance errorsy in the datahub is based on the Energy industry's guideline "Those left on the balance sheet 
handling of errors after balance sheet closing" [3]. Balance sheet errors are based on all 
to processes that change the balance sheet data of the seller or the measurement data of the place of use in the balance sheet window 
outside. Processes that produce balance errors are: 
• 
DH-211 Notification of measurement data / correction of measurement errors outside the balance window7 
• 
DH-300 - the so-called contract processes described in chapter 3.2.5 retroactive contract processes, 
where changes are made to the validity of contracts outside the balance sheet window (retroactive 
contract initiations, terminations and cancellations) 
• 
Performed manually by the datahub operator at the operators' separate request 
balance sheet corrections. 
It should be noted that with the introduction of the data hub, separate readings of measured measurement data 
the smoothing calculation is not performed. Those based on the annual usage estimate of metered objects 
updating measurement data with reading-based measurement data and the need it causes 
corrections between the parties will be processed in the same balance sheet error processing process 
like other balance corrections. 
 
7 for reading measurement targets (use locations where the measurement method is other than "continuous measurement"). 
measurement data is always reported retrospectively, which creates balance errors.

3.6.1 
The process of calculating and processing balance sheet errors 
 
FIGURE 494949 BALANCE ERROR CORRECTION PROCESS DIAGRAM 
The correction of balance errors works in datahub according to the diagram above. Datahub initially configures 
Location-specific vendor balance sheet information with information at the time of calculation. Balance sheet information is understood here 
in addition to the definition in section 3.2.5, also according to the time step measured at the place of use 
energies for the corresponding period for which the seller has balance responsibility. The calculation is performed only for them 
for places of use for which new measurement devices outside the balance window have been registered for the calculation period 
changes in balance sheet information that have not yet been taken into account in previous calculation times. 
The location-specific time series compiled from the balance sheet data at the time of calculation is called 
"measured information". After this, the result of the calculation is compared to the so-called 
to the balance sheet time series, which is based on the information reported and locked in the balance sheet or already 
to the data corrected in the previous calculation. More precisely, the measured information is compared 
to the information corrected in the previous calculation for the time period that was also processed in the previous one 
in calculation. In other respects, i.e. to the extent that the time period in question has not been included in the previous one 
in the calculation, the measured information is compared to the one valid at the closing time of the balance window 
information. Any differences in the comparison are recorded as balance sheet errors and the seller's correction in euros

is obtained by multiplying the difference by NordPool Spot's regional price in Finland. After this in the beginning 
the determined balance sheet data at the time of calculation, i.e. the so-called the measured data are stored as balance time series values, 
to which the calculation result performed next time will be compared again. Because measurement data 
are always treated as positive in datahub, will be taken into account in the calculations of balance errors 
the sign of the calculation depending on whether it is a place of consumption or production. 
After the calculation and acceptance of the datahub operator's calculation results, the datahub forms 
all vendors' measurement area-specific repair invoicing materials and forwards these 
to distribution network operators and sellers, in so far as the parties have the right to information. Materials include 
by place of use, so-called measured data, balance time series values ​​and balance errors and measurement and 
balance sheet errors of the vendor-specific compilation. Distribution system operators use the information in the material 
to perform vendor-specific refund/repair invoicing for their own measurement areas and 
sellers can use this information in their balance error invoices reported by the distribution system operator 
for review. 
3.6.2 
Balance errors caused by corrections of measurement data 
Regarding corrections of measurement data, balance errors are recorded only for those sellers who have responsibility 
regarding correcting the invoicing of the customer's sales contract in accordance with chapter 3.3.4. Measurement errors 
regarding the balance sheet errors are always corrected for the seller who has during the measurement error's effective period and 
contract information valid at the time of calculation of balance sheet errors. In other words, mino typing error 
correct for those sellers who are in the balance sheet due to their own mistake in their own balance sheet 
responsible for the consumption of the place of use without the actual right (contractual information) to bill 
customer for consumed electricity. The distribution system operator must always report the corrected measurement data in full 
for the effective period of the error and not only for the period for which the seller invoices the customer 
the repair. Thus, it is ensured that the data hub always has correct and up-to-date information 
also available to customers and third parties. 
3.6.3 
Balance error of measurement range loss 
In addition to places of use, balance errors are also related to losses in the measurement area. Loss balance errors 
is recorded in the balance sheet of the loss seller of the measurement area. Losses are also affected outside the balance sheet window 
reported corrections of measurement data as well as such corrections of balance sheet information where the place of use remains 
without a salesperson or for a place of use without a salesperson, a salesperson is added. Losses of measurement areas 
the balance error time series can be calculated by summing all the usage locations in the measurement area 
balance sheet errors together, taking into account the sign of the balance sheet errors. The balance time series of losses is formed 
like the place of use, of the values ​​locked in the balance sheet/losses in the previous balance sheet error calculation 
of values ​​updated according to measured data. Balance error calculation of losses in the measurement area 
"measured information" can be calculated inversely by calculating the balance errors of the losses and the balance time series 
values ​​together and finally the measured data calculated in this way is stored in the balance time series after the calculation 
for. The loss seller of the measurement area is not notified separately of balance error information from those places of use, 
whose balance sheet errors have caused a balance sheet error of losses. In other words, the loss seller gets the information 
only from the total error of the losses. Errors in the balance of losses are not reported to the seller whose losses 
sales in the measurement area have ended.

Balance sheet errors regarding netting and energy companies 
Netting and energy community calculations are performed as soon as netting or energy community 
measurement data is delivered to the relevant point of use. This also applies to situations where delivery is required 
measurement data is directed outside the open balance window. Possible in the calculation of balance errors 
changed netting calculation or energy community calculation values ​​are compared in the balance sheets 
to the closed original values ​​or to the values ​​of the previous balance error calculation. The treatment is the same 
regardless of the distribution method of the energy community's surplus energy (SMA or SMB). Balance errors 
is formed if the netting and energy community calculation values ​​have changed in the balance sheets 
after closing. 
3.6.5 
Execution of balance sheet error calculations 
Balance error calculations are only performed at separate times by the data hub operator. Otherwise 
that is, automatic, such as scheduled, balance error calculations are not performed. There will be balance errors 
to repair in accordance with ET's instructions for each place of use, 3 years retroactively twice 
per year. The calculation of balance sheet errors can also be started from the market party's separate account 
on request, if the balance error is large and it is wanted to be dealt with quickly. Calculation can be done 
if necessary, perform for a single measurement area or place of use. All repair billing 
the balance sheet and balance sheet error data that were the basis are stored as historical data from time to time 
for revisions. Thus, the data hub always has information on what was initially reported to the balance sheet and 
how this information has been corrected later in each balance error calculation run.

FIGURE 505050 MEASUREMENT OF INDIVIDUAL BALANCE ERRORS AND BALANCE ERRORS AND 
INFORMATION ON DEALER REGION-SPECIFIC ASSEMBLIES 
When calculating balance errors, it is worth noting that a single balance error is always related to two 
to the seller. For two sellers of a balance error, the said balance error is always the same amount, but different 
sign (positive on one and negative on the other). Therefore, all balance sheet errors 
the total amount of energy and the euro amount is always zero per calculation run. The cause of balance errors 
is determined based on the event caused by the balance error as follows: 
• 
Correction of measurement data: correction of measurement data notified by the distribution system operator 
• 
Correction of seller information (balance sheet informationjen correction):  
o The balance information of the place of use has been transferred from one seller to another 
o A salesperson has been added to the salesperson-less usage location 
o The place of use has been left without a seller

In the structure above, the product can be, for example, "Time transfer", which has two product components: 
"Day transfer" and "Night transfer". A calendar time series is a time series whose time step value can be either 0 
or 1. If the value is 1, it means that the relevant time step is applied 
product component. The calendar time series must be created for each year separately, because the calendar 
may depend, for example, on public holidays, which are timed differently each year. In the calendar time series 
the transition to summer and winter time and the extra day in leap years must also be taken into account. 
Calendar time series must be announced by the end of September at the latest. The price time series tells 
price for each time step. 
3.7.2 
Establishing the product 
When creating product information, all necessary information about the structure of the product is reported in the product information. 
Once the product structure has been declared, it cannot be changed. Structural information is indicated by one 
event and in this product creation event, the party indicates whether it is related to the product 
single price or price time series. If the type of the price of the declared product is BG01=Price, 
the product is only approved when the price of the product has been reported to the datahub with a separate price information 
with an update notification. The product is not active until the price is announced. The price of the product cannot 
update retroactively. If the product's price type is a price-time series, the product is active immediately 
after the creation of the product, even if the price time series has not yet been announced. Price time series 
can be reported a maximum of one year retroactively.  
The product can also contain a calendar time series. A calendar time series defines those moments in time, 
in which case the product component of the product (night or day electricity) is valid. The calendar time series is announced 
with the same event as the price time series.    
Datahub's products consist of one or more components. For each product 
one's own component is declared, even if the component in question is used in the rest of the party 
in the product. With this, different prices for components can be announced for each product.  
Product names and components can be reported to datahub in different waysyesterday. The languages ​​are Finnish, Swedish and 
English. The combination of the product ID and the component ID and the product ID is 
be individual. If the product is cancelled, the product ID cannot be used again.  
3.7.3 
Maintenance of the product's structural information 
The parties can maintain their own products. The product's structural information contains information about the product 
and product components. Structural information can be used to maintain product names and 
product component name and tax rate. If necessary, the product can also be given an expiration date. 
When the end date is announced, the product remains expired in datahub and no changes can be made to it anymore 
then.  
The parties cannot maintain the product structure after it has been announced. That is, the product cannot be added or 
components cannot be removed from it after it has been deployed. If such 
changes need to be made, it should be done by announcing a new product to datahub and deciding 
existing legacy product.

3.7.4 
Reporting a price or price time series 
When the party needs to change the prices of the product, it is done with its own notification.  
The parties always announce the new prices to datahub at least one month before the price of the product 
entry into force. A new Price Notice always determines the new price of the old valid price 
effective date to the previous day. If the price needs to be updated retroactively, e.g. error 
due to this, the party informs the operator of this, who makes the necessary update. A party can 
only change the prices announced for the future and this is done by replacing the old price 
new.    
The prices reported to Datahub are reported both with and without VAT. Thus 
it is easier for other parties to use exact prices in customer invoicing. Taxable 
calculating the price from the tax-free price can cause differences in decimal precision and this has 
impact on invoices sent to the customer. 
There are also products where payments are based on different conditions and calculation formulas, 
where more billing criteria are used than the realized electricity consumption of a certain hour. Such 
can be, for example, power-based products where the payments are based on a certain interval or 
to several maximum measured electric power. For these products, price information is provided 
to datahub, however, the unit prices of the product. 
3.7.5 
Searches for product and price information 
Market participants can search for product information and product price information from datahub. 
The distribution system operator's product information is public and searchable by all parties. Seller's product information 
can apply for those parties who have a party authorization given by the seller for product information. 
The search for product information is divided into two different search events. You will apply at the second application event 
structural information of the product and price and price and calendar time series information on the other.  
With the structural information search event, product information is always requested by party, but search 
can also be refined based on the product ID. The search can also be specified if desired 
only search for valid information or historical information. 
In addition to party information, price information is searched based on the product or product component. Search 
can be limited by giving a time interval according to which price, price-time series or calendar time series data 
applied for.

DH-730 and DH-740 Declaration and search of invoice line information 
3.8.1 
Invoice line information 
Sellers and distribution system operators can, if they wish, transmit invoice line data via the data hub. 
Invoice line information can be used, for example, when the party has agreed with the customer 
that the customer receives one bill for both electricity sales and transmission. In this case, the other party 
can inform the biller of all the billable data of the usage location using the bill line data 
to the party. The party that delivers the invoice line data to datahub verifies the invoice line data 
when forming, that the information is forwarded to the right recipient. It is indicated in the invoice line information 
in addition to the data of the sending party, the party ID of the receiving party and when there is 
it is a pass-through invoicing, including the contract ID of the receiving party. This is information that 
the parties get through the contract processes. If, for example, the distribution system operator delivers to the seller 
calline data, the distribution system operator must be able to form the line data of the network contract 
to the right recipient, taking into account a possible change of seller.  
 
In the example picture, the contract of seller B starts on May 1, 2019. Online contract not in case of change of seller 
change If the distribution system operator has agreed with both sellers on network pass-through billing, 
the distribution system operator must ensure that invoice line information is no longer sent to seller A on 1 May 2019 
from the starting billing period. 
Invoice line information can also be used when forwarding billing information to an invoicing provider 
to the service provider. If invoice line information is reported to the service provider, then not to the recipient 
there is no contract ID of the party. The parties must agree before the invoice line information is delivered 
with each other on the transfer of information and informs the party authorization between the parties for billing information 
in the user interface of the parties. In the user interface, the authorizing party selects the authorized person and informs 
validity period for the authorization.  The party authorization covers all between the authorizing parties 
count lines.  Receipt of invoice lines can still be delegated to another party. That is, if 
the distribution network operator authorizes seller A to receive the invoice lines, seller A can still commission 
to the service provider of forwarding own invoice lines C. The customer cannot give authorization for invoice information 
to a 3rd party. 
The party reports the invoice line information to the data hub after it has created it in its own 
in their system in accordance with their own invoicing processes. Invoice line information is reported 
with the accuracy of the product component. For example, an electrical product is reported as a separate line 
possible basic payment component and energy component. It is stated in the invoice information 
separately for the entire invoice period, but also for each invoice line, the period for that line 
concerns. In the billing period, the billing lines may have, for example, some subsequently corrected ones

information and therefore these do not always match. Invoice line information can also be used to report 
possible invoicing of service fees from one party to the other as separate lines. Of invoice line information 
can also be used to indicate the billable amount of the power component of a power-based product. Thus 
Invoice line data does not necessarily need to be maintained by the party invoicing the customer 
calculation rules affecting invoicing.  
The declaration of invoice line information is not canceled or changed. If the sending party corrects its own 
billing, it is his duty to send the repair information as his own invoice line data to datahub 
through to the receiving party as credit lines and then as new debit lines.  
The invoice line information is reported according to the structure below.

3.8.2 
Search for invoice line information 
The parties retrieve the invoice line information from the data hub in the same way as other messages belonging to them. 
A more detailed description of datahub's data transmission principles is described in the document Datahub 
External Interface Specification. A separate search event is not needed for normal data 
in mediation.  
A separate invoice line data search event is intended for viewing individual data. 
(The application event will be implemented in the next part of the project.) With the application event

invoice line information of an individual place of use or contract can be searched when there is a need to find out 
from the datahub, what information has been transmitted from one party to the other through the datahub. 
The counter lines described above can be searched based on the time period. In this case, the search returns all the calculation rows, 
whose time interval intersects the time interval indicated in the search. For example, an application for the period 1.1.2019 - 31.3.2019 
could return calculation lines with the time intervals 15.12.2018 - 14.2.2019 and 15.2.2019 - 14.4.2019. 
The search is always limited by the place of use and, if necessary, by the contract code of the invoiced contract. 
In the transmission of invoice line data, those according to the valid invoice regulation will be taken into account 
requisites. Datahub's invoice line information also supports the future Finvoice 3.0 standard 
transmission of identification data.

DH-800 Authorizations and mandates 
In addition to contracts, the rights of Datahub's parties are managed through authorizations. There are authorizations 
two types: 
1. Authorizations given by the customer, with which the customer gives consent to their own personal and 
to electricity consumption data. The principle of these authorizations is described in the figure below 
with the number 1. 
2. Authorizations or mandates given to each other by the Datahub parties, by which the parties 
give other parties the right to their own information or the right to perform a role 
according to the task. The principle of these mandates and party authorizations is described below 
in the picture with numbers 2 (orders and party authorizations given by the seller) and 3 
(mandates and party authorizations issued by the distribution system operator).

The authorizations given by the customer are always site-specific and must be given 
validity period, which is a maximum of 2 years. The validity period must correspond to the intended use. 
For example, purposes 1b and 1c of the table entitle the grantee to the same information, 
but the validity periods of the authorizations differ because the purposes of use are different. Authorizations 
also provide a measure of justicefor a different period of time depending on the type of authorization, 
if the customer has had a contract for the point of use. If the customer has authorized a new vendor, 
for example, with the authorization type Request for quotation, the vendor has the right to the information for two days, but 
the metering data will be received retroactively for one year. If a customer who is just moving to a 
new point of use gives authorization, for example, to a new vendor, the authorization will also be stored in this 
situation for the customer and point of use. In this case, the customer's information shows that the authorization has been 
given in relation to this particular point of use. In this case, the customer cannot give authorization for 
metering data, because they have not previously been a customer of the point of use and therefore do not own 
metering data, until the date of the move. If the customer moves out of the point of use for which they have given authorizations, the authorizations will be automatically terminated in Datahub upon moving out. 
Similarly, authorizations provided by the customer are automatically terminated as soon as the customer information is updated to indicate that the customer is “encrypted”. 
The customer issues an authorization to the seller or a third party, after which the party can retrieve the information specified in the authorization from Datahub. In accordance with the Electricity Market Act and the current Data Protection Regulation, authorization from the consumer customer must come directly to Datahub by the consumer customer himself. Therefore, the consumer customer always issues the authorization himself using strong authentication

through the customer portal provided by Datahub, which is described in section 3.12. Parties can 
report the authorization of a corporate customer on behalf of the customer in accordance with the authorization notification event. 
The use of authorizations will be monitored later in the project using measures to be planned. 
The same combination of customer, party, point of use and purpose of authorization cannot be repeated in Datahub, but authorization notifications in which those 4 pieces of information are the same as in an existing authorization will overwrite the existing corresponding authorization. In this way, the authorization's 
end date can be updated if necessary, for example, if there is a need to terminate the authorization earlier than agreed. 
If the customer has had several agreements for the point of use, so that between their agreements 
there has been an agreement with another customer, the authorization grants rights to the information from the latest agreement. 
Both consumers and business customers can manage their authorizations (add, delete, edit) in the customer portal provided by Datahub, which is described in chapter 3.12. 
3.9.2 
Party authorizations and assignments between parties 
Authorizations between parties have two different purposes. With a party authorization, the parties allow the other party to obtain information that is not possible to obtain without the authorization. An assignment, in turn, grants permission to act in Datahub on behalf of the other party. 
3.9.2.1 
Party authorizations 
Party authorizations between parties are required for receiving invoice line information and for product information reported by the 
seller. Party authorization is granted in the parties' user interface by selecting the 
desired party and the function to be authorized. Party authorization can be granted to several 
parties at the same time.

invoice line information provided by them. The seller can, if he wishes, further assign what he has received 
receipt of invoice line data in accordance with the party's authorization to the service provider of his choice.  
3.9.2.2 
Assignments between the parties 
With the assignment between the parties, the parties determine the events that the party can 
perform on behalf of the other party. Normally, the recipient of the assignment is a service provider that does not have 
otherwise, you would have the right to work in the data hub.  
The orders given by the parties to each other enable sellers and distribution system operators 
service providers' direct connection to the data hub. These service providers must have a contract 
with the datahub, in which case they get access to the interfaces of the datahub system.

assignment needs.

Assignments between the parties can be given per data group and/or event. 
Events reported to Datahub can be assigned to several parties, but 
events sent from the datahub can only be assigned to one party. If the seller or 
the distribution system operator has outsourced some function to its service provider, says this 
with an assignment to datahub, which party is entitled to which information (e.g. customer and 
location information and their search) and which event to initiate (e.g. measurement data 
delivery). The authorized party gets the rights to the data hub's data in accordance with the information in the assignment and 
to processes (such as delivery of measurement data). Market participants notify the data hub operator 
of the necessary assignment information and the operator makes the corresponding updates to the datahub
to the system. The parties can view assignment information in the datahub user interface.  
If the party has given another party the right to perform as an assignment in datahub 
on behalf of the information search-type event, both the person who gave the order and the order 
the receiving party can perform the information search as if they were the party giving the mandate. If 
delivery of measurement data has been given as an assignment to another party, the assignee 
the party can request a copy of the changed information.  
The parties can give an assignment to any datahub party with whom 
the party has an agreement to perform some task. The assignment can therefore be given to someone else 
to the seller, the distribution system operator or a 3rd party, in which case each party can act in several different ones 
role towards the data hub. Assignments between the parties can no longer be forwarded 
to a third party. The party that received the mandate can therefore no longer give the mandate itself 
to a new party for the same information or function for which he himself received an assignment. Neither 
the party cannot forward the authorization received from the customer to a third party 
to the party. Events related to party information (DH-9XX) and customer and usage location information 
update request events (DH-112, DH-113 and DH-124) cannot be delegated to another 
to the party.

DH-900 Party data maintenance 
Party data is maintained in the data hub both for the needs of the parties and the data hub operator 
needs. The parties need each other's contact information and billing information. Yestahub operator 
needs information about the parties, related to service contracts. As part of the service contract process 
the operator will find out the necessary mandatory information from the party.  
Although information is transmitted from one party to another via the data hub, there may be situations where direct 
contact between the parties is necessary. For these needs, in datahub's party information 
the parties' contact information for contracts, invoicing, measurement data, balance sheet errors is maintained 
and in relation to collection. For these types of contact information, the contact person and their phone number are indicated 
or email address.  
Datahub maintains information about the party's billing addresses, i.e. the addresses to which the other parties 
or the datahub operator can send the invoice. Datahub maintains different billing addresses 
for needs, i.e. invoicing of balance errors, joint invoicing and connection and disconnection costs 
for invoicing. Regarding invoicing channels, the parties have at their disposal a paper invoice and an online invoice.  
New parties are always established in the datahub by the datahub operator. The parties may 
however, after this, the parties maintain their own data provided by datahub 
in the user interface. Datahub announces the registration of new parties, the termination of parties and 
the parties' information is updated for all datahub parties.  The distribution system operator can 
in connection with the notification, also the necessary information for sending balance error invoices. 
Party information can be searched with a separate search transaction either through the GLN of the requested party
a single organization with an ID or several based on the role of the requested party 
party. Party information can also be searched in the user interface offered to parties.  
Information about the parties is maintained according to the category diagram below.

3.11 
Structural changes in the measurement area 
This chapter describes the situations where individual measurement points are moved from one measurement area to another 
or where the entire management of the measurement area is transferred from one distribution system operator to another. 
The descriptions have been made primarily from the perspective of the data hub. This chapter does not cover them 
situations that belong to normal market processes, where for the existing measurement area 
new measurement points are added or measurement points are taken out of use there. 
In connection with structural changes in measurement areas, there is a need to exchange information about the changes 
between market participants. Regarding the structural changes described in this chapter, it is 
however, from relatively rare processes and these changes are also often very large 
number of places of use (possibly even hundreds of thousands of places of use).  Described below 
processes are not carried out with normal market messages, but a separate one is used for information exchange 
data transfer method based on a transfer file.  The parties form a data hub with the support of the operator 
csv file to be moved. Using this file, the datahub operator and 
the distribution system operators participating in the transfer will make the necessary changes.  
It is worth noting that when the usage locations are transferred to the control of another distribution system operator 
without exception, the distribution network operators must always implement a separate data hub among themselves 
data conversion, where data is transferred from the current network operator to a new one. In terms of change 
overall, it is important that the new distribution system operator can secure the data hub and its own 
in connection with the change of data correspondence in the information system. 
The changes described in part in this chapter also affect eSett's systems. This is why eSett 
you must also agree on the change in advance before carrying it out. In general, the measurement range 
structural changes should be agreed well in advance with the datahub organization so that 
a controlled implementation of the change can be implemented. 
The processes also involve the transfer of network contracts to another network operator. In these changes 
network operators should note that changes must be made in accordance with the network service conditions. 
The changes always also affect the sellers of the respective measurement area, so precise communication 
of such situations is of paramount importance.  
3.11.1 
Transfer of control of the measurement area 
This chapter discusses those situations where the measurement rangemanagement will be transferred in full to the 
new network company. In Datahub's data model, this applies to the connection between the metering area and the distribution system operator (see image below).

PICTURE 555555 TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT OF THE ENTIRE METERING AREA 
The transfer of management of the metering area to another network company does not in itself affect the other 
structure of the metering area. For example, the usage points belonging to the metering area will be transferred as such to the management of the new 
network company. Information will be stored in Datahub about which network operator has been managing the metering area at any given time. 
When the management of a metering area is transferred from one distribution system operator to another, the following 
procedures are involved: 
• 
Ending the management of the metering area for the current distribution system operator and starting it for the new distribution system operator from a certain point in time. 
• 
Transfer of network agreements from the current distribution system operator to the new distribution system operator. . 
Network agreements are transferred as such from the current network company to the new one. 
• 
Calculation of imbalance errors for the metering area for the current distribution system operator. 
The procedures related to the transfer of metering areas from one party to another are always initiated by the Datahub operator. The Distribution System Operator does not have the right to directly control which metering areas are under the management of the relevant distribution system operator in the user interface provided by Datahub. 
3.11.1.1 
Transfer of network contracts to a new distribution system operator 
When the operator initiates the transfer of the metering area, the 
valid metering point, contract and product information of all metering area usage points shall be reported to the new distribution system operator for confirmation.

This is done by generating a report from Datahub on the usage points included in the transfer. The report 
contains usage point-specific information on contract codes and product information. The new 
distribution system operator supplements its own information, to the extent that it will change, in the same 
table regarding contract codes and products. Contract information is also reported to the new 
distribution system operator for those network agreements that will come into force 
in the future. 
The Datahub operator uses the supplemented file to carry out the actual transfer transaction. 
The new distribution system operator must ensure that it has reported its new product information to the 
datahub before updating the information. If the new distribution system operator needs to update other 
network agreement information, such as the contract billing method, it must update this with a separate 
contract information update event after the operator has made the transfer for each usage point. 
With the transfer of network agreements, the rights to the information of the corresponding network agreements are transferred to the 
new distribution system operator. The boundary points are manually transferred from one metering area to another 
after the actual transfer event. 
3.11.1.2 
Transfer of rights to the new distribution system operator 
When the management of a metering area is transferred to another distribution system operator, the new distribution system operator will have the right to the information of all boundary points, production units and usage points in the metering area and the 
network agreements affected by the transfer. The new distribution system operator also has the right to the change history of all this information that has been registered in the datahub. Thus, the new distribution system operator also has the right to this change information from the time of the event when it itself was not responsible for the management of the metering area in question. The current distribution system operator's right to the information ends on the day when management of the metering area is transferred to another network company. 
The transfer of management of the metering area must also be taken into account in terms of the exchange of information in market processes. Information exchange related to market processes is carried out with the new distribution system operator for all metering area information from the time when ownership of the metering area is transferred to the new distribution system operator. 
3.11.1.3 
Rights to point-of-use information 
According to the data model, metering points are not directly related to the distribution system operator. The right to the metering points and their information is always established through the metering area. Thus, a change in the ownership of the metering area will also transfer ownership of the data for the usage points. 
The new distribution system operator of the metering area will have the right to the usage point data for the entire 
history of the usage pointfrom time. 
3.11.1.4 
Balance statement 
The transfer of control of the measurement area to another party does not directly affect itself 
for balance settlement calculations, as the measurement points do not move from one measurement area to another. A situation where 
measurement points move from one measurement area to another, is described separately in chapter 3.11.2. Information

of the distribution system operator of the measurement area, with regard to the balance sheet, it mainly affects which information 
the party has the right in datahub. In this respect, the information also affects what information the datahub
in the events are forwarded to each distribution system operator. The current distribution system operator has the right 
to balance settlement information (in the message interface or in the user interface provided by datahub) only for that 
until the day when the measurement area is transferred to the new distribution system operator. Newly 
the distribution system operator has the right to all the historical information of the balance sheet. This also applies to information 
about which seller has been the loss seller of the measurement area or the open supplier of the imbalance at any given time. 
When management is transferred to a new distribution system operator, the data hub must ensure that 
balance sheet information is reported to both the new and current network operator of these rights 
in accordance with. 
Changing the person responsible for the measurement area must also be agreed with eSett in advance. 
3.11.1.5 
Calculation of balance sheet errors 
When calculating balance errors, the distribution system operator managing the measurement area must be taken into account 
change. This is due to the fact that the invoicing of balance errors is the responsibility of the distribution system operator and 
it has a direct impact on the network company's finances. The previous distribution system operator of the measurement area will 
balance error calculations can be performed until the day when responsibility for the measurement area is transferred to a new one 
to the party. This should be possible from a general calculation performed on the entire market 
separately. This ensures that the current distribution system operator does not have to wait for months 
handling of balance errors, for example, in cases where the current distribution system operator 
business ends completely for the company in question. The transfer of the measurement area and related 
after a separate calculation of balance errors, the new distribution system operator is responsible for all new ones 
of balance errors throughout the history of the measurement area. Therefore, from the point of view of the data hub, the former 
balance sheet errors affecting the management period of the network company, which are detected and registered only after the transfer 
after, are always recorded to the new distribution system operator. However, online companies can of course 
mutually agree separately on which of the companies is financially responsible for these afterwards 
of detected errors.

3.11.2 
Division and merger of measurement areas 
This chapter discusses the situations in which control of the measurement area is maintained at the same time 
with the network operator, but one or more measurement points (location of use, border point or production unit) 
is moved to another measurement area. The things described in this chapter also apply in the situation when 
the measurement area is divided and in connection with the division a completely new measurement area is created for which 
measurement points are moved. The measurement points can either be transferred to another of the same network company 
to a measurement area or to a measurement area completely under the control of another grid company. Datahub 
in the information model, these changes concern the connection between the measurement area and the measurement points (see 
picture below). Datahub will store information about which measurement area the measurement point belongs to 
heard at any time. 
 
FIGURE 575757 TRANSFER OF MEASUREMENT POINTS FROM MEASUREMENT AREA TO ANOTHER 
To the extent that the management of certain places of use and their online contracts is transferred to another 
for the network company, the same principles as for rights and information exchange are followed 
beforeis described in this chapter. 
Next, we go through the necessary measures for each type of measurement point separately. 
3.11.2.1 
Places of use 
Moving locations to another measurement area should always be agreed on well in advance, at least 
monthly in advance before the transfer with datahub staff. If the places of use are transferred to another 
to the network operator's measurement area, the procedure is the same as in the situation where all the measurement area

the usage locations are moved to the measurement area of ​​another distribution system operator (see chapter 3.11.1.1). Datahub 
the operator implements the transfer of the usage location and the network contract to the new measurement area separately 
with the help of a location-specific file created for the transfer, as in the previous chapter.   
Using the same principle, the usage locations that are transferred by the same network operator are also transferred 
from one measurement area to another. 
3.11.2.2 
Cut-off points 
In Datahub, the border points are always between two specific measurement areas. Datahub doesn't have it 
it is possible to change separately both measurement areas to which the limit point is connected. Practically 
when part of the measurement area moves to another measurement area, new ones must be created in the data hub 
border points between these two measurement ranges related to the case. In these situations, no 
basically, there is no need to decide on existing border points. If, on the other hand, two measuring areas 
merges, in practice the boundary points between these two measurement areas must be determined. 
The management of border points is directly the responsibility of the distribution system operators, and the distribution system operators can 
perform the necessary actions in these respects in the user interface provided by datahub. 
3.11.2.3 
Production units 
The distribution system operator can create new production units in the user interface provided by datahub. 
However, the processing of production units differs from border points in that the measurement areas 
in the changes, the termination and creation of the production unit cannot be applied. Production units 
otherwise, the existing production facility would have several GSRN identifiers and 
the measurement data would be divided into several measurement time series for the production plant in question. 
The transfer of the production unit to another measurement area is always done by the data hub operator. 
The procedure also requires changes in eSett's system, and the datahub operator is compatible with these 
about making changes with eSett. 
3.11.2.4 
Balance statement 
The transfer of measurement points from one measurement area to another affects the balance settlement calculations. 
However, changes in measurement areas do not require separate manual steps 
in connection with balance sheet calculations. The balance sheet calculations are defined in such a way that the calculation takes 
automatically takes into account the measurement area to which each measurement point is connected at any given time. 
Changes in the measurement areas are reflected in the calculation results of the balance sheet, just like the measurement areas 
in losses as losses changed. In connection with changes in measurement areas, it is always good to be more precise 
monitor the results of the calculations, as possible errors in the processing of changes can have an impact 
significantly to these results. On the other hand, this is also a good way to detect these possible errors. 
3.11.2.5 
Calculation of balance sheet errors 
In the calculation of balance errors, the transfer of the place of use to another measurement area should be taken into account 
correspondingly to when the distribution system operator managing the measurement area changes (see chapter 3.11.1.5).

Balance error calculations must be able to be performed until the day when the locations of use are transferred to the new one 
to the party. If necessary, this can also be done in a general way for the entire market 
from calculation separately. 
3.11.2.6 
The division or unification of the measurement area in the areas of the current network operator 
The diagram below describes the work steps, how the division of the measurement area or

Complex changes and information 
It is very possible that from a business point of view, the change will also include the 3.11.2 measurement area 
division and merger and control of the entire measurement area to the other party. You could do that 
happen, for example, in a situation where the measurement area is both divided and the existing one 
the network operator will completely stop its operations and one half of the network will be transferred to the third 
for the network company. In these situations, the principles and measures described above can be applied 
separately in two or more steps so that even more complex changes

can be processed. This also applies, for example, to situations where more than two 
the measurement area is connected to each other. 
It is particularly important to process changes in measurement areas, both for the datahub operator and also 
communication of distribution system operators participating in the transfer. The process touches many parties and 
everyone must find out in good time what kind of change it is. Datahub-
the operator must be notified of changes at least one month before the actual change 
entry into force.  
Such implementations of structural change also involve manual measures 
for the distribution network operators themselves than for the data hub operator. Manual operations must be done before 
the actual transfer and after the transfer, and detailed instructions will be made of these 
contains the necessary measures for all parties. We will check at the same time 
the process descriptions related to the change to a more detailed level. Change must be planned and scheduled 
carefully so that the parties involved in the transfer are able to take care of their own 
its share in the implementation of the transfer. When planning the change, it must also be taken into account that it 
implementation will not cause unnecessary disturbance to other parties. In order to those extracted in the change file 
there will be no changes to the places of use before the transfer, we always try to schedule the actual transfer 
for the weekend.  
To the extent that updates require changes in eSett's system, datahub will take care of it 
on the agreement and implementation of the necessary changes with eSett by the distribution network operators 
on behalf of. Naturally, distribution system operators are involved in the discussion to the extent that their 
participation in the process is needed.

Customer access to own data 
Datahub will offer customers a user interface, the so-called customer portal, where 
customers can see information about themselves registered in datahub. In the customer portal, the customer can 
see the measurement data, contract data and other data of their usage locations. The customer sees everything 
his own information, regardless of which network company's territory his places of use are or who 
sells electricity to them. In addition, the customer can look at which companies, which data and for which period 
he has given authorization and if he wishes, the customer can change this authorization information. Provided 
the customer adds new authorizations or removes existing ones, datahub sends a notification to them 
to parties whose authorizations the customer has maintained. The customer can delete via the customer portal 
"encrypted" mark from own data. The handling of an "encrypted" customer is described in more detail in the chapter 
3.1.2. 
In 2017, a new national suomi.fi service was introduced in Finland, which is aimed at 
for all citizens. The customer's access to the datahub's customer portal is organized by the respective service 
through. In the Suomi.fi service, citizens can centrally see registered information about themselves 
in the registers and authorizes other citizens to manage their own affairs. in the Suomi.fi service 
companies can also authorize individuals to access company information. The customer can use the above 
said authorizations between persons and between persons and companies, including datahub 
customer portalin use. The Population Register Center is responsible for the development of the Suomi.fi service.  
Below is described the process of how to create access for the customer to the service offered by datahub and that 
through to the customer-specific information contained in the datahub.  
 
IMAGE 606060 CUSTOMER ACCESS TO THEIR OWN DATA 
The customer can access their own information through the following steps: 
1. The customer switches to the Suomi.fi service using an internet browser.

mobile certificate). 
3. The customer opens the "My electricity data" view in the Suomi.fi service, which shows limited 
some information about the customer registered in datahub and from which the customer can log in to datahub

Reporting required by the Energy Efficiency Act 
According to the Energy Efficiency Act, the seller of electricity must deliver to the person connected to the distribution network 
to the end-user customer once a year free of charge and properly report this energy 
of use. The law requires, among other things, the presentation of consumption data for the past 3 years, 
comparison of the customer's actual electricity use with other similar customers and information 
on measures to improve energy efficiency. Datahub will compile a user group-specific one 
anonymized sum-level consumption and small-scale production data that can be used by electricity sellers 
comparison data required by the Energy Efficiency Act in its own customer service 
in forming. A more detailed description of this information and the data transfer method will be determined 
in more detail in a later project phase. Possible delivery methods are for example in the chapter 
The data interface described in 2.5, the open data interface maintained by Fingrid or in quantitative format 
report.

Repairs performed by the Datahub operator 
The main rule in the data hub is that the information stored in the data hub always comes from market participants. There is 
however, there are situations where the parties cannot update information in the data hub through normal processes 
and support from the datahub operator is required. In this case, the operator performs the necessary 
on behalf of either a party or end customer of the process, with own broader access rights. 
Examples of the most common repair processes are described in the following chapters.  
3.14.1 
Corrections related to contract processes 
With regard to contract processes, it has been described in relation to retroactive notices of contracts that if 
between the start date of the retroactive sales contract and the time of notification, the place of use has 
valid sales contracts of more than one different seller, the parties cannot agree with each other 
agree on a retroactive contract. In this case, the situation remains for the operator to figure out and 
to be repaired. The operator will clarify the situation related to this repair chain from the parties and leave it 
along to make repairs. Depending on the situation, the operator will cancel any contracts and also 
notify the termination, if necessary, of the remaining contract. To be done by the operator 
datahub does not send notifications to the parties about contract cancellations. If the operator this 
terminates the sales contract according to the repair chain, notification DH-331 is sent to the seller in question 
according to the process.   
In accordance with the normal process flow, contract terminations are never notified retroactively, 
except in case of meter removal. However, if the party needs to correct the contractual situation so, 
that a contract should be terminated retroactively, the operator is notified, who can do this 
retroactive termination (for example bankruptcy situations of the end customer). Retrospective decision 
can be made for both sales and online contracts. Retrospective actions made by the operator 
notices of contract terminations are normally sent to the other parties and also to it 
to the party whose contract the operator has terminated. 
Corrections to contract information are usually also accompanied by corrections to balance sheet information. Repair situations 
during the investigation, the operator also finds out from the parties the situation of the balance sheet information and does the necessary 
corrections to balance sheet information based on information received from the parties. Balance sheet informationno corrections will be sent 
notices to the parties.  
In the future, the Datahub operator will also handle those notified to the operator by the distribution system operator 
sales contract disputes. Disputing the contract is described in chapter 3.2.4.4. Provided 
the operator completes the dispute of the contract, sends his own notice of the disputed contract 
to the seller with reason code AR05 - Denying the contract.  
In the data conversion, the initial data is brought to the data hub. Not all information imported in data conversion can be 
to process information imported in accordance with datahub's processes with the same rules. By way of illustration 
contract cancellations. In Datahub's processes, rules have been created for cancellations as to what 
happens to previous contracts. For contracts imported through data conversion, no 
there is no previous information in datahub, so contracts imported through data conversion cannot be used normally 
cancel according to the cancellation process. If the parties need to cancel the data conversion

imported contract, the datahub operator must be informed of this, who will cancel in the datahub. 
If there is a need for the previous agreement to take effect at the place of use, the operator will investigate the situation 
from the parties related to the place of use and inform the possible previous seller, if he comes 
report the contract to datahub.  
3.14.2 
Corrections related to customer data 
Regarding customer data, the parties can maintain all other information except the customer's identifier. Provided 
the customer's identifier must be corrected, the party informs the datahub operator of this. Operator 
makes the necessary correction to the datahub and all the parties who have the right are notified of this 
to this customer information.  
The parties can change the customer's own ID of the party given to the customer 
as a personal ID or y-ID in accordance with the customer data update process. In situations, 
in which case the personal ID or y-ID provided to the customer in the change process can already be found in the data hub 
from another contract, datahub rejects the party's notification of change. In this case, the party must 
notify the datahub operator of this, which connects the party with its own ID 
to the customer information found with the personal identification number of the consumer-customer's customer information. On the party's own 
the contract information of the consumer customer with the ID is linked to the one with the personal ID 
under customer information. At the moment, the connection of customers by the operator only applies 
consumer customers, but the process will also be enabled as a further development 
for business customers. 
Regarding the consumer customer, it has been defined that the consumer customer manages his own authorizations 
through the customer interface offered to them. If for some reason the consumer customer cannot make it 
to decide on the authorization they indicated in the user interface, the customer can ask the operator 
to decide on the authority's behalf. Termination of the authorization is done in the datahub system 
always in the name of the party who has the authorization. A notification will be sent about the termination of the authorization 
to the party whose authorization is decided.

3.15 
Process chains in the datahub system 
Processes that have a clear dependency on each other have been created uniformly in the datahub system 
process chains. Process chains allow us to create pre-defined 
entities in which all processes in the process chain must be completed to the end of the chain 
to process. Monitored lead times can also be defined for such process chains. 
Individual processes related to process chains can also only be based on specific cause information 
reported events. The processes belonging to the chain always have a connecting factor, the same 
location ID, contract ID or customer ID and/or the associated message identifier.  
An example of such process chains is the announcement of a new sales contract in a moving situation and 
related new online contract confirmation. When the seller announces a new sales contract 
to the datahub and the datahub concludes that it is a move, it sends this to the network company 
online agreement to be confirmed. Based on this, an open system is created in the Datahub system 
event information for the network company, which becomes ready only after the network company is 
reported confirmation to datahub. The time limit for the event is two business dayseh 
from the notification received from datahub. This event appears as an open event in the network company 
in the data. These two business days have been defined as the lead time of the process chain and the data hub
the operator, like the network company itself, has the opportunity to monitor that the event is responded to 
within the time limits. Datahub's user interface has its own control view for such openings 
for events.  
Some events cannot be reported except as part of a process chain. For example 
confirmation of the online contract cannot be reported to datahub other than when the seller is 
notified datahub of a new sales contract based on which an unconfirmed one has been created 
network contract and open transaction for the distribution system operator. 
The table below lists the process chains defined in the data hub. The process in parentheses 
is part of the process chain under certain conditions, but not always. For example, DH-312 should follow DH-311 
happens if a new network contract is needed for the place of use.

System accessibility 
The principles related to the accessibility of the system and the support service model are included by the partyten and 
to the service agreement between datahub. However, the same are described in this document 
the principles according to which the datahub system is available to the parties and according to which 
the operator will support the industry in using the datahub system. 
Basically, the system is always available, i.e. 24/7, unless there are disturbances or the system is down 
there are no pre-planned maintenance breaks. 
The system's environment (facilities, equipment) will be of high accessibility (usability) 
environment, i.e. it is designed in such a way that the accessibility of the environment is at least level 
99.9%, i.e. outages caused by the system's environment statistically occur during the year, 
taking into account all the hours of the year, should be around 9 hours at the most. Also the system and 
with regard to the system environment's data security and data communication, there must be readiness to support high 
accessibility. 
The operation support service of the system environment is at the level of the target response times for disturbances 
and in terms of solution times, that it supports the set level of accessibility. 
These solutions aim to create the best possible conditions so that the datahub system itself 
is accessible and that it is in use and that the possible disruption is not caused by the data hub's hardware 
and environmental factors.  
The use of the system, i.e. the applications themselves that are used in the data hub, requires disruption and operation support and 
an organization ready for that, which takes care of communication between the different parties 
between user organizations and service provider organizations. Support makes sure that 
disturbances detected by users or situations related to assistance in use are resolved by the industry 
within the agreed response times. Disorders are classified according to severity levels and for everyone 
a resolution time is defined for the severity level. Disturbances can occur e.g. in the operation of applications, 
in user interfaces with which the system is used or in data exchange interfaces between different systems and 
between the datahub system. 
With regard to their systems connected to the datahub system, the parties must maintain a corresponding interference 
and user support if the fault investigation requires it, which is responsible for the party in question 
on communication and investigation regarding disturbance situations.  
3.16.1 
Users related to system administration 
Users related to system management and troubleshooting are: 
• 
data hub administrators named by distribution network operators and sellers, who correspond to the information 
from the mediation of distribution system operators and sellers' own measurement and customer information systems and 
datahub system or use directly via the user interface datahub -
system or are responsible for its functionality. Companies have an obligation to keep the information 
about the main user(s) up to date in the datahub system.

• 
Fingrid's system is managed by master users 
3.16.2 
System support service model 
A disturbance situation in which support service is needed can occur at any user level. It can be seen 
for the customer, e.g. so that the process used to manage the creation of a new electricity contract and electricity 
the connection to the new place of use does not go through and thus a new contract and connection cannot be obtained 
confirmed.  
The disorder can be caused by: 
• 
Datahub system not working or malfunctioning, 
• 
With the Datahub system and the datahub systems of the seller or the distribution system operator 
connections, intermediary services or applications between communicating systems 
from inaction or wrongdoing, 
• 
the system that communicates with the vendor's or distribution network operator's data hub 
from inaction or wrongdoing. 
• 
denial of service attack from an external party in terms of system use. 
Disturbance, e.g., in the delivery of data of one distribution system operator and in the event of a disruption in processes can 
affects the operation of the entire datahub system and the termination of processes.  
The system's support service model is three-tiered: 
1st step support: The customer (consumer/company) is in contact with the seller/distribution system operator 
for customer service/support in all situations concerning the customership of the end customer, 
services, invoicing, collection and contract terms with the distribution network operator/electricity seller. 
The end customer is also in contact with the distribution network operator/electricity seller in all of them 
in situations that concern the data stored in the data hub from the end customertoja This support holds 
also includes guidance on the datahub's end customer user interface. 
The end customer (consumer/company) is in contact with Fingrid Datahub's customer service 
in situations where the end customer's contact concerns the data hub's end customer 
user interface operation error situations, data security, data protection obligations or the service 
accessibility. 
2nd step support: The designated principal users/support persons of the seller/distribution system operator will contact you 
To Fingrid's datahub support service, if the problem cannot be resolved with the 1st step support.

3rd step support: Fingrid's datahub support service contacts the system 
to the application support service, if the problem cannot be resolved with the 2nd step support. 
3.16.2.1 
Reporting of disturbances 
The Datahub system has its own system for managing disturbances where the main users can 
reports the disturbances it detects. The company's main user classifies the severity of the disturbance (1-4). Fingrid's -
the main user can, if necessary, justifiably modify the severity information of the disturbance. Information about the change comes out 
to the person who reported it. In case of a disturbance, the main users are also in touch, if necessary 
by other means.  
The main users of the companies can only see and follow the progress of the problem investigation in their own company 
for reported disturbances. 
Disorder severity categories: 
1. System use is completely blocked or use of a single part classified as critical is 
completely blocked (class critical, critical). 
2. The use of the system is partially blocked and there is no workaround or a single one 
the use of the part is completely blocked (class high). 
3. A system malfunction causes significant harm to its use, but the system is 
available and a detour for use exists (disruptive category). 
4. A system malfunction causes a slight inconvenience to its use, but the system is available 
(class low, low) 
The critical functional areas of the system are:  
All the following transactions related to contract processes (DH-300): 
• 
DH-310 Creation of contracts 
• 
DH-330 Termination of Contracts 
• 
DH-340 Cancellation of Contracts 
•

Appendix A Descriptions of balance sheet calculations 
This appendix describes in more detail how the items to be calculated are selected for the balance sheet calculations 
time series. In the descriptions of the calculations, input refers to the information that must be provided 
to perform an individual balance sheet calculation. Other selection conditions mean those conditions, 
on the basis of which the time series used as the basis for the calculations are selected. of these terms 
fulfillment is checked in time steps and the amount selected is calculated 
from the time series only those values ​​when all conditions are met. Based on location information 
in the performed calculations, time step-specific ones can change, especially the measurement method of the place of use. 
In practice, the type of place of use cannot change, and the measurement area to which the place of use belongs changes 
very rarely.
