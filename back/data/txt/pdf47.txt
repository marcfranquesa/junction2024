Jenni reviewed the reports from the customer service (appendix 1), where e.g. it appears that the end customer
the number of contacts has increased significantly recently. In January, the end customer

If there are any peculiarities in the list, the end customer should send us, for example, a photo
capture from their end customer portal. Pia asked if the data hub is given to end customers 
provided contact information / contact persons, Jenni replied that it is not given but requested 
just to be in contact with the seller's / network's customer service. 
 
Jenni also presented the quick instructions for cancellations, which have been attached to the working group's material 
(Appendix 2). The instruction seemed good to the working group, Greetta stated that of course only practical 
in the situation, it becomes clear whether the instructions are helpful. Niina asked where she could deliver the possible ones

feedback on the guide when practical experience with the use of the guide appears. Jenni replied, 
that with a ticket through the support service.  
Elina went through the reports of the development team. Elina presented event numbers and event training
from the last month. Pia highlighted the issue related to customer data update requests
gelman, where at least one system has received useless update request messages, which
because of this, Fortum has not processed these messages. Elina stated that FG has noticed 
the quantities have turned to decrease, so corrections must have been made. Suvi comments that there is-
the gelma would have already been fixed. Pia said that there have been so many problems with these that 
updates of customer information from networks have been completely stopped being processed. Summer 
said that the system supplier has made a lot of fixes in this regard. Elina stated, 
that it has also been noticed at FG that the quantities have declined after the turn of the year
i don't know  
Suvi told about customer information updates, using the DH-311-7 event as an example, that for one sa-
there may have been dozens of updates for model y in one day. Greta 
asked when the work of the customer data sub-working group will start. It was concluded that the sub-working group start-
next week (February 6, 2023). Greetta also asked in which cycle the development proposals 
end up on the list, Marko said that practically every 3-4 weeks they are added from the tickets 
to the list. Greetta asked if it was possible to completely ignore the updates of the customer information 
from the seller to the network, etc. Piia and Suvi commented that this would not be very important
pocket friendly. Marko stated that it is good to recognize all these suggestions and 
to inform the sub-working group of the development of customer data management.  
Pia commented that the spikes in the middle of the moon in the DH-320 events are visible in the picture 
is because fixed-term contracts are being renewed. Elina also presented how the DH-125
the event has been used (it hadn't been used much yet), Minna said that it was last week 
90 places of use in the quarter measurement, 61 energy communities have been notified.

Development team - Elina Konttinen 20 min 
Elina went through the procedures for the December-January failure reportrelated to grants (Appendix 3). Various malfunctions
since then, various precautionary measures have been introduced, for example timeouts 
related test scenarios to test environments. Marko commented that finding out the root cause 
in these situations it is difficult and takes time. Recently (27.1., 30.1. 31.1.)
related to timeouts, one of the root causes turned out to be heavy memory use (extract
Fingrid's own PowerBI report, which was timed, was taken out of use on 31.1. in the evening because 
caused an extra load on the system). The actions of the parties have also been monitored, that 
can these have an effect on the operation of the system. Pia asked if there was enough "kick
cat", i.e. memory in the system. Elina commented that the memory was added last time 
week, Marko commented that the challenges are more related to the system's architecture 
related to. Jari commented that the production of reports should be created from a "copy stock", not
from the stock.  
 
Pia commented that, contrary to what had been announced, the problem with timeouts has already appeared at 
6 in the morning and FG has been told that the problem only started at 9, so it should be reported that 
the problem started when it really is. Suvi hoped that the entire field would be sent
doksi newsletter on the topic, what has been achieved and what measures have been taken.  
Pia also told how challenging and laborious it is for contract notifications and contract updates

checking and reporting again after error situations. Niina Leikas commented
said that it is very important to inform customer service as soon as possible
soon after the fault situation. Päivi Karppanen agreed. 
 
Pia commented that it would be good if a low threshold was sent as information to the industry 
even milder situations, when something small is possibly going on. We'll let you know 
that, for example, there is "random slowness" in the system, which verifies that the service user
that the fault situation is already known. Jenni stated that the interpretation of disruptive situations is often 
also really challenging, for example FG's customer service notices possible timeouts
problem situations when using the user interface, at the same time as others. Päivi asked that 
what time we will be there at the datahub. Jenni said that customer service will start 
at 7 a.m., if a problem is detected before then, you should submit a ticket to the support service.

Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision – 2 h 30 min 
The development proposals under consideration were reviewed according to the agenda, the proposed solutions attached
in tee 4 "Datahub change requests 20231701" 
• 
#43, Laura presented a development proposal according to which the DH-321 event does not need
your joke states deadline dates, both as a resolution and not 
make a change, because with the previously recommended development proposal #35 DH-321-
the event's inspection rules have already been changed to version 2.0 so that
the dates of the meeting will not be checked if they do not change during the event.  
o Pia: OK, no need to change 
o Jari: No need identified, let's go with this 
o Päivi: I agree 
o Suvi: agree 
o Mia: agree 
o Greetta: agree and if a change is still required after 2.0, then process
I will then pay separately 
o Kari: I agree 
o Niina: I agree 
o Pekka: Ok 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: We support the proposal that no 
make a change according to development proposal #43. 
• 
#93, Laura presented the development proposal and solution description DH-311-11 event-
regarding the country, according to which the seller would be able to reject the retroactive contract
through its notification interface.

Suvi asked a clarifying question that if the previous seller has time to answer 
For DH-311-11, how the rejection behaves in this context. Laura said, 
that at this point information about the retroactive agreement has not yet been released 
to the previous seller, so the previous seller would not have received in this case 
no information about the retroactive contract (the new seller can make a rejection 
only before the retroactive contract is sent to the previous seller for approval
to ignite).

o Greetta: Puoltan, brings more automation and sounds sensible functionally

#109, Päivi presented the development proposal and Laura the solution description. Laura said, 
that the datahub should already work as described, but individual ones have been identified 
error situations in which the DH-312 transaction remains open, even though the corresponding sales
pimus has been cancelled. Thus, no change measures are proposed here, but problem-
the correction of situations proceeds as a bug.  
o Niina: Would it be possible to inform about more open events in the newsletter 
about problems / what could have happened. That not every party always needs to 
think about a solution to the problem yourself 
o Pia: No problem identified 
o Jari: Not recognized 
o Päivi: Not identified 
o Suvi: Regarding the deletion of open transactions, I would like to know the knowledge base
hin problems as a summary of what known problems are open 
there are currently events 
o Mia: agree (on both issues)

#156, Laura presented the development proposal and solution proposal e-mail

set by tahub for the reason for starting the information contract. At the same time, we went through the development

this (ET's development team) have already advocated. Laura stated that ai-
immediately discussed with ET on Friday 3 February 2023. 
o Päivi also told regarding development proposal #186 that you have to be clear 
information about the reason for starting the contract - this is really important 
information. 
o Pia: Taking into account that these can be encountered in business deals, business
mint deals are handled as vendor exchanges. Development proposal OK. 
o Jari: In Poland, a drop-down box for choosing the reason for the contract would be good.  
Laura clarified that datahub notifies, based on datahub's reasoning, that
kean's starting reason, i.e. a pull-down box is not needed. 
o Päivi: Thumbs up 
o Suvi: Poland, as it is now would allow abuse. Additional information text

o Niina: It sounds good, especially that datahub tells you which contract
its starting cause is. The number of characters should be more than 150.  
Suvi further specified that the seller's own additional information text should be sent via e-mail 
and datahub's reasoning about the starting reason is brought to the e-mail. fit-
there was also a discussion about mus's exchanges, but Laura mentioned that in these 
in these cases, information is never sent to the previous seller DH-311-11-

from the development team. In attachments 4 "Datahub change requests 20230117" and primer

that you would see this from the measurement information system if something is not aligned correctly. 
Suvi comments that it depends on the system and how the measurement data system

the proposal has been perceived as quite useful, but perhaps it could be used to

#58, Laura presented a development proposal that is also related to development proposal #198. 
Where does the order of arrival of events become a problem. If the disconnection annunciator
the contract comes first and the end of the contract only after many hours
water, in which case you have to find out manually what is causing the disconnection notification. The meter 
disconnection due to depreciation is ok, but disconnection for unpaid invoices 
then produces additional clarification work for the seller.  
o Suvi wanted to specify that statistics should be obtained on how mo-
that party has this mode of operation (i.e. the disconnection is done before measuring
mastectomy decision). Niina wondered if the right way to leave would be
min to notify the reason for disconnection with the disconnection notice. Pia commented that 
see no reason why the seller should know the reason for the disconnection at all - if 
the network cuts off the electricity from its own claims, this does not belong to the seller if
county way. Pia also said that the seller should send his own disconnection
request in any case, this is not affected by the network disconnection notification. Network 
can also sometimes cut off the electricity at the customer's request (Suvi com-
mentored). Niina asked if this development proposal is therefore not more 
related to collection processes, and not related to concluding contracts is
gel  
 
Niina comments that if we think in terms of the collection process: if the network 
cut off the electricity due to open invoices and would report this with the reason Agreement-
violation, the seller could, based on the notification, send his own disconnection request
no. This would be to the customer's advantage in the sense that there will only be one outage. 
Päivi commented that the network is not allowed to inform the seller of such information. Summer 
you noticed that you can't add additional information to the event precisely because of this, 
because this information must not be passed on (data protection issue). Suvi stated that wed-
the situation of the hit proposal sounds like it is a single party 
the problem of own processes. Pia nodded that this shouldn't matter 
to the seller's processes, that the network bills are unpaid.  
 
Suvi said that in no document does it say that the network should broadcast 
I did the same event, now the normal 30-day time limit to report has been defined 
meter removal. Niina comments that the business process says that 
if the state of the place of use changes, then JVH should inform as soon as possible
scold for it. Greetta comments that it violates industry guidelines, 
if this were to be changed now. Pia stated that thus this is related to
already to the GDPR. 
 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: We will discuss ai-
more about him with the developer of the development proposal ticket.

#162, Laura presented the development proposal and suggestions for its solution 
Incorrect behavior has been noticed on the part of customers, the contracts are main-
done with the current seller due to moving out and there is also an online contract 
decided in the same. The same customer has since made another seller 
with as a move-in to the same place of use of the contract. It was found that 
datahub in these situations, however, notices that it is

change of seller, when a new contract for the same customer is finally announced. 
Laura presented different options to handle the situation.  
o Pia commented that, in general, based on media reports, fewer lop-
old customers know how to do this. In general, we joke around so that we do it 
contract in the name of the other spouse. Päivi comments that Facebook also has 
advised to make new contracts by moving out. Niina thinks that 
however, there has also been a lot of giggling in the news these days, so 
the amounts may increase. 
o Suvi comments that he has made a ticket on a similar topic before 
and there will certainly be more of these cases, can we leave in an orderly
as a "policeman" between them, or should the situation just be accepted. 
Suvi added that she understands the problem and that it is good that the central
to play. Greetta commented that datahub could tackle this problem pa-
tighter.  
o Suvi commented that for collection customers, collection after moving out 
ends and new collection actions always begin when a new contract begins. 
Niina added that traditionally when a new network contract starts on the network, yes 
it is not as easy to collect invoices as within the same contract. Also 
Päivi commented that in these situations new ones will be added to all systems 
contracts and it affects the collection side. 
o Pia also commented on the problem regarding business deals, that 
the customer is first switching to seller X and then cancels the seller's
exchange and returns to the original seller, the time window for the seller change is not-
is no longer possible, in which case we may have to use
country emigration.  
o Niina comments that she would not like additional work, but in these situations for the networks 
could come under scrutiny if a new network contract comes with completely identical ones 
with information. Suvi comments that if we start doing something (i.e. datahub 
would act as a police officer here), the whole process should be described so that the customer does not 
end up being bullied (the end result is quickly that the customer doesn't have 
no more electricity). Niina added that even the network cannot recognize what 
has happened to the seller, but cuts off the electricity after receiving the move-out notice-
i can Greetta comments that there is no time to follow these online, 
rather, these disconnections are handled through automation.  
o Pekka commented that the system should prevent these and loopholes should be
kata, could it be possible that the logic of the datahub would smell the same
emigration and immigration at the same time, would prevent it and direct the
of the battery to the old seller. What is required as a technical implementation is not 
can evaluate. The contract should end up going back to the old seller, if 
there was a deadline.  
o Suvi commented that the gig customer should contact the current one 
to his dealer and tell him that he hasn't moved out. Pia commented that 
the best solution would be if you could move out at this point

to cancel by the old seller. Laura comments that here
the system should return information to the new seller that here the customer
the contract could not go through either, but the customer should contact the
I'm looking for a seller. Pia said that these are often handled online, 
in which case no one can separately direct the customer to the old seller. Soon 
said that the situation is challenging, message the reason for rejection to the new seller 
should be really clear. Pia added that how in these situations online
can also instruct the customer when the network has only been informed that the
mus ends with moving out. 
o It was also discussed how sometimes it is necessary to correct contractual situations 
through moves out, for example in situations when another seller leaves 
from the market and the seller's business is transferred to another seller. Mia asked if 
in this situation, you have to use emigration. Pia stated that it is, 
because there is also a 14-day time limit for terminating the contract. Päivi stated that 
the datahub should have logic that recognizes in these situations "exit
van" of the seller.  
o Niina said that sometimes there can be a customer who has closed the contract 
for moving out, but you still need to notify the target immediately after
invented electricity. The network cuts the electricity and the customer can no longer connect 
to his old dealer and has to take the contract for a while to the new dealer
again. Pia commented that in a somewhat similar situation are renovation firms
countries that make this kind of notification of emigration generally
for contracts that are valid until further notice. Pia commented that in general too 
there are a lot of people moving on their moving days.  
o Suvi commented that the same could be raised for ETto the discussion, Pia was 
agree, and that the electricity sales conditions also state that the customer can 
terminates his fixed-term contract to move out. Greetta commented, 
that has been expected in the industry because Fingrid takes a tighter grip on similar ones 
in monitoring abuses. Suvi asked if she could take these quantities so-
also up (for the same customer, moving out and is interpreted as a change of seller and 
the customer remains the same) for the report? 
o Päivi also asked how many of these "tricksters" there are and how many there are 
repair situations where this gimmick just has to be used. Pia added that 
numbers are very important to know in this regard. Pekka commented, 
that there could be a process that would alert the data hu-
bissa - Pekka also stated that the situation would first be looked at as a whole
tena, and wouldn't start thinking about each side plot separately. Marko 
suggested that a smaller working group could create a more detailed overview of this.

#193, Laura presented a development proposal in which it is hoped that a common 
operating method for the industry. The proposal asked for an approach to whether there will be 
the seller concludes his own contract for moving out before the network company announces the
about the removal of the meter at the workplace, or whether the termination of the contract would result in the removal of the meter 
therefore come first from the network company's side. 
o Suvi comments that it feels strange that the customer is talking to the network 
break the subscription and this would be directed to the seller's side to conclude the contract

Greetta commented that the same situation as under construction, when the seller 
it is not possible to know the measurement date of the object, nor in this case in the situation either 
when the meter will be removed from the target, because they are the tasks of the network. 
Päivi said that she doesn't think there are many networks that work the same way
power. Niina agreed.  
o Pia asked if the author of the development proposal could indicate the networks that 
this is how they instruct, and in this situation they could be instructed separately 
networks, Suvi agreed. Mia noticed that in the process document 
has been mentioned here with certain inflections, whereby some networks can the situation 
interpret in a special way. Suvi commented that in removing the meter this pro-
the instructions in the session documentation should not be followed exactly
behind.  
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: We will specify the document
mentation regarding this. Greetta drafted the instruction text "Distribution network operator 
inform about the termination of the contracts of the place of use before announcing the place of use 
decommissioned".

#197, Päivi started the development proposal and Laura the solution description. Already related to the
mass to item #99 discussed in the meeting. Do you even need to send it to the seller?

Jenni clarified that it is often a situation where the seller announces the

there will be no more similar events. Laura comments that can it be, 
that the seller sends the transaction again for repairs and that here 
would improve with the implementation of development proposal #93, in which case the seller 
would be able to cancel the erroneous notification himself. Suvi commented that pi-
it would really be advised not to hastily send new events.

o Pia commented that the user interface instructions should also be updated in general. 
Niina added that there is a need for in-depth training in the concepts of open events
tely, the old trainings were very general in nature, but we need training
also about the processing of different events. Pia said that old we-
binary recordings could be used. Suvi commented that special situations 
separate instructions would be required for treatment (e.g. removing the meter and reinserting it
modification without shifting the start dates of the contracts or retroactive
notification of foreign contracts through the locking process)  
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Marko stated: let's supplement the
no system changes are made.  
Minna went through the development tasks related to the internal development of the data hub for the development team.
you, solution descriptions in the appendix "Datahub changes requests 20230117":  
• 
#201 Minna introduced the development target to introduce validation also for the netting calculation
for the places of use in nasa, the same would also apply to the DH-123 event.  
• 
#202 Minna presented a development item related to netting and energy community calculations. 
A validation is introduced in the calculations that objects under construction are not taken into account in the calculations.
in the cells, whereby the statuses of the series are sufficiently strong (are validation
flaws in 2.0). 
Summary of both proposals and their promotion: To proposals #201 
and #202 there were no comments, it was stated that good corrections.  
In addition, the development work group was informed of the preparation situation regarding the list of development proposals 
the following points in the appendix "Datahub change requests 20230117":  
• 
#178 Marko stated that it is related to the development proposal discussed in previous meetings
see #57. Minna presented the situation of the development proposal: It concerns tenants under construction

o Marko told about the content of future versions, there was a bottleneck from the previous development
from work and after 2.0. The starting point is the realization that went through in the December seminar
plan, but no more detailed content about the versions yet. Updated directions
the plan is to get it done in the next few weeks. Datahub's system provider 
a new order agreement is being concluded with in order to obtain development
suggestions better forward. 
o Electrical support 
o Marko said that Datahub has had a discussion with TEM about how 
datahub could support the electricity subsidy situation regarding batch 2. November-December 
the information is delivered to the seller on the last day of January
by type/location of use. The customer will be in accordance with the HETU forces of the contracts

the parties would be able to download this information for themselves. Solution proposal 
and the format will be refined, from which a sub-working group will be organized 
with a separate meeting.  
o Marko asked the group for a comment, or whether they will comment only when the
the proposal has been published in its entirety. Pia commented that the meeting 
could be earlier (initially proposed 22.2.2023 days), in practice 
if it's held that late, sellers don't have much reaction time. Pia stated, 
that you should get the basics/policies ok/no ok (both customers 
are still consumers), it has an effect on what the parties end up with 
they do. 
o Pia and Suvi commented that the message should be sent to the industry as quickly as possible
up to which blade is used to proceed here, e.g. in webinars. For the newsletter 
could tell right away what datahub is doing. Marko 
your sum, let's do the technical implementation with the system suppliers 
17.2. and before that we try to highlight other actions to shape the webinars
dosa. Pia stated that the instructions in the law are exclusive to the customers 
situations can change quickly (the customer's salespeople change between
superstructures). How does the old seller know which address to send to the customer 
send a refund invoice. Sellers should receive up-to-date information on customer
information in April, Päivi and Pia stated.  
o Based on the discussion, the sub-working group meeting date proposed for 17 February 2023
around 9-11. Marko stated that the material for that meeting is not necessary-
without finishing 2 weeks before the meeting as is normally the case. 
o Greetta will move to Väree at the end of March to develop the customer information system
wine. Marko stated,that at this stage there is no need to move because of this
composition of the country's development team.  
o Suvi asked if it is possible to take someone else's place from the same company if there is an obstacle
to, for example, a meeting of a sub-working group. Marko answered that it was originally 
meant that the role in the development work group is personal.  
o Suvi asked about the review of the previous memo, that it would be reviewed at the beginning of the meeting 
these issues left open at the previous meeting.  
o Marko commented that the issues raised in the previous meeting do not avoid
have not yet progressed, to which Suvi stated that Datahub can in these situations
you just say that you are still working on it. 
o Suvi commented that the agendas of the sub-working group of customer information could also be put in Pal-
to the velut portal to view the field. Greetta specified that underemployment should also be mentioned
regarding the references of the development proposals in the material passed to the group 
that they can be found in the development team's changes wishes excel. 
o Greetta asked if the comments had any business implications of future development changes
comments received on the specification descriptions. Marko said that there have been proposals 
from four companies and if there are contradictions, etc. so let's bring more
