Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision – 2 h 
o #178, (Fingrid), measurement data process,  
Marko initiated the change request based on Appendix 2. Greetta comments on the topic Energy industry
on the basis of the development team (several companies and their representatives were present). 
ET's position was that in the long term we should aim for a unified model, but now that ti-
the loin is on and we are in trouble, we would advocate going back to the DH 1.0 model.

If FG does not start to generate zero until the target is connected -state, it would be
damn problems, that there is an intermediate model in use. Return to the operating model according to the 1.0 model 
would be best and later we would think about a longer-term model. ET wished he could 
DH is still figuring out his own role and would, for example, start delivering zero. Marko asked, 
whether the majority of ET's group had challenges with the current model. Greetta stated that 
yes, because of this it was hoped not to continue with this current model. Suvi Manninen asked, 
how does the current 2.0 model work for standard consumables (e.g. light poles), is it capable of these 
today to deliver measurement data in any way. Do I have to come up with a measuring device for these? 
to a datahub that does not exist in your system? Marko asked if these are 
always under construction. Jani Pasanen commented that these cannot be connected. 
Greetta comments that for these situations a virtual measurement has been created for the system
devices. Mia stated that they also have this way of working.  
Jari Arve joined the meeting at 9:18 
Marko continued the presentation of the proposal and told about what was discussed on 11 May 2023
in the development work group.  
Marko asked who owns the measurement data, if the datahub processes the measurement data here
in addition. Sari Savikoski stated that this option (4) has not been included in the internal discussion
carry in the bones. Tarja Teroheimo asked whether the evaluated status belongs to strong or weak
to hin statuses. Marko stated that there should be a strong status. Tarja stated that in this case
it could be good for datahub to generate these with an estimated status. Tarja stated that 
it is not possible to take a position on the issue of ownership of measurement data. Jani Pasanen commented that the data
hub has already taken ownership of billing information in netting and community items and if you think about it 
that this would only be datahub's new invoicing information (i.e. zero would be billed) this does not harm
I guess. Petri Juhala stated that if these enter the systems with the status evaluated, then this one 
would be a good thing.  
Marko asked about invoicing for less than a day, who hasn't been able to do it yet, how big 
group members see the change.  
• 
Christian: It doesn't really matter, there is work anyway. We deliver an estimated
be set to zero for the portion that is not metered. Maybe at that point you can com-
to mentor more when we end up thinking about alternatives. Preferably permanent 
solution, like echesty demolition solutions. Managing to get in part-time, at the moment 
the hourly values ​​are stored in batches of 24, if there are changes to this, then it will
to war based on it. 
• 
Jani: It's some kind of workload to get the series of lessons complete, let's take a stab at it 
believes that a full day will be added to the invoicing system. Missing values ​​can be
hut in different positions. 
• 
Pasi: At work, it's going pretty smoothly.  
• 
Petri.
also We need work. I can't say what the job is like.  
• 
Sari: Needs development, the opportunity to fill in with zero series, would require development.

• 
Tarja: We can live with the matter at the moment and the invoicing can be done
for about a day, but not the best possible solution. If there is 
a model that remains permanent, measures are required to get everything 
a fully functional and reasonable solution.  
• 
Jaakko: We are able to bill for less than two days, there are no problems here or there 
require additional work. 
Marko continued going through the material. A shift has occurred - has the invoicing management
in relation to the watch, something that causes changes in the system? Or is the val-
does it exist to be billed based on the quarter?   
• 
Christian: The concept is ready on the development side, it has not been developed yet-
terrestrial. Will come at some point (when customers need it). 
• 
Jani: Basically, for those systems where the systems have a quarter/hour level, 
support has been built but not yet deployed. 
• 
Pasi: It's being worked on, hasn't been put into use yet 
• 
Petri: Invoicing has not been introduced. Plans for this are to be-
mass, but there has been no need to tune it up 
• 
Sari: Something on the roadmap.  
• 
Tarja: With a roadmap, more detailed plans and implementation are missing. In the plans 
is when there is a need and demand.  
• 
Jaakko: Along the same lines, we are waiting for the need and demand, there are plans.  
Marko continued with the introduction of different options. How much option 1 (continue the 2.0 model 
accordingly) requires that there be proper support for this?  
• 
Christian: There is a discharge solution (we deliver zero so that we can calculate
tua), when there is no all-day hourly information. You have to get rid of the liquidation solution, if 
we want it to work properly. 
• 
Jani: More systems are tuned here, there is no problem with new systems, 
but the older ones have detunings. If you wanted to get rid of the can, there is no need
who knows what it would take.  
• 
Pasi: There is a proper solution in the works, which is being done all the time. Probably a few 
coming into use in a month. 
• 
Petri: Somehow it can be solved, but not a smart model for these. Must be employed with this 
at the moment, no bigger solutions have been thought of, but it has been expected that
here is the solution of what to do (get it right at once or a temporary solution). 
In terms of schedule, it can be done quickly when the decision comes.

• 
Sari: A demolition solution exists, but a larger implementation has not been done. If to this 
let's go, let's wait to see what the final model is. 
• 
Tarja: Very much the same situation as the previous couple, mostly works, final 
the solution would require doing, waiting for DH's decision on what will be done. Toi-
I could that the solution is not this option (1). 
• 
Jaakko: It works just fine for us, I don't recognize it as a teardown solution. There are no bigger ones 
plans to fix or improve, works well. 
Marko went through option 2 (let's go back to the 1.0 model). It would be received in January at the earliest 
2024 for production. Marko asked if it causes pain that there are two different operating models (some
measure, some do not provide measurement information). 
• 
Christian: Here is a solution to the second option and the readiness for the other
raan. This would be suitable as a temporary solution.  
Pauliina came to the meeting at 9:47 
• 
Jani: Bad, because there is a lack of a unified operating model. It must be in the seller's head 
old system or unloading system, so that even half the days can be invoiced. 
In any case, we have to make two different solutions. 
Greetta stated, based on the discussion in ET's development group, that a return to the old 
the model is supported by a large part of the operators. 
• 
Pasi: There is a technical implementation for both, that's fine. 
• 
Petri: Maybe ochallenges these days, there may be detuning and non-detuning
ty, I can't say directly what kind of challenges it can cause. 
• 
Sari: It could be a good temporary operating model until a longer-term
lin's operating model. Of course, the problem here is that there is no unified operating model. Interim
as an operating model, this could be good. 
• 
Tarja: Also good and profitable for us as an interim model. Longer-term mal-
Li would be given more time (if this is done on a relatively quick schedule). 
would be reached). Does not cause major changes. 
• 
Jaakko: We can manage with both. 
Marko went through option 3 (sending the measurement data is mandatory). Let's go over what 
system suppliers agree with this option. 
• 
Christian: The weakest option for us, it won't be a quick solution because there will be 
to demand development. It is by no means our recommended version, but of course
I guarantee the market participants' position on this.

• 
Jani: It would be possible to send measurement data for classes under construction, but it is not
also a very good option. It would unify the operating method, but what is the long term 
term solution. Not our favorite option. 
• 
Pasi: Technically, there is no change for us, there is a change for the measurement data partner. 
Market participants decide whether this is a good option or not. 
• 
Petri: It's not about us, it's about measurement data solutions. I won't take a stand. 
• 
Sari: We had business experts from both the product side and services, who com-
mentioned this and the service business supported this option. In this context 
it was raised (and in option 1) that how the effects of other systems
from the corner would be. Unity here was a good thing. Somewhat requires system-
on the side of (network) system development. 
• 
Tarja: This option did not cause applause and cheers, the whole and 
considering the schedule is not considered the best possible model. Tasks available 
yes, it would require a little work, but considering the whole, it was not seen as reasonable and 
as an aspirational model. 
• 
Jaakko: Same as Petri, nothing to comment on as a customer information system. 
Marko asked Sari (who supported option 3), which entity would impose on network companies the obligation to
to send measurement data to under-construction participants. Sari has nothing to comment on this. Not either 
comments from others. As a background, Marko stated that FG has a statutory responsibility and business
the purpose of standard definitions is to guide and instruct the operation. 
• 
Pia: I see that it would be good to have a solution that supports future goals, no sense 
to pack up and bring development that will take a long time. Have to drive a long time-
interim solution. 
• 
Jari: A final solution must be sought. 
• 
Greetta: It's not really a problem for us, as Jaakko stated, I rely on that 
what ET's team said because some had big challenges. Could you go find out? 
DH's role in this, a unified solution would be obtained. DH would direct this doing. 
• 
Kari: It doesn't directly concern us, but the final solution should be thought through.  
• 
Päivi: Nothing new to add, agree with others (long-term solution).  
• 
Suvi: A special suggestion on whether to force or not. Crazy would help with that, 
that sellers have billing information. As a network, these are seen as growing e-mail
as surveys, relaxations would reduce work. 
• 
Mia: I agree with Suvi. If you ask about the party, then this is DH's matter. 
• 
Niina: No for option 3. I lean towards what Greetta also said, but it would be good, 
if there was a long-term solution, but also the possibility to deliver if desired 
measurement data. Over a longer period of time is a matter for DH.

• 
Pekka: Doesn't touch us. I am in favor of a long-term solution. DH thing 
ultimately say what to do. 
Marko went through option 4 (2.0 rules, but datahub returns missing values 
to the seller). What do system suppliers think about this option? 
• 
Christian: The alternative requires the most discussion, maybe not the most favorable option. Pit-
the long-term solution requires some sort of development if the network supplies measuring
room for the whole day. Maybe this depends on what the emphasis is here, good discuss-
scapegoat, if FG goes to deliver these, it will also work, but it also requires something. 
Almost every option requires something ifwe want to get rid of demolition solutions. Pi-
to think about what the market participants want, which solutions are the easiest hi-
from its point of view and within its framework, a solution will be made. A longer term solution 
is the most important. 
• 
Jani: Would it also be in the transmission of measurement data that datahub supplements, i.e. pis-
would you like the additions to the forwarding message? 
 
Laura stated that this would only apply to searchable information, i.e. in mediations no supplemental
would. 
 
Jani: If necessary, the seller will search for the whole day's time series from the data hub.  In that man-
it would be good if the measurement data / billing values ​​could be retrieved from datahub, no 
would need its own disassembly solution. This solution is absolutely possible for us, it requires 
some work though. 
• 
Pasi: Technically it would work for us already. 
• 
Petri: From our point of view, if we get strong values ​​for invoicing for something, yes 
that's a plus. If you think about the long term, I don't see that this is the best change-
a condition From our point of view, development is not required, but some other alternative than 
this, is better. 
• 
Sari: Good comments from Petri, can't say which is really good and 
what a bad thing. Option 4 was not supported by us, probably a small ke-
a hit is needed. Regarding option 4, the point is that whether the search for measurement data -
from event new process to site processes good? Good luck to everyone
a nice solution would be the best. 
• 
Tarja: Good reflections on whether this would be a reasonable model in the longer term. 
From our point of view, technically it can be done with reasonable work, but is it longer
in that time frame, a direction worth going to.  
• 
Jaakko: It works technically. I'm not taking a stand on whether it's a good or bad solution. 
Marko continued the conversation. What is the desired long-term operating model?  
• 
Pia: If you think about the end customer's point of view, the situation is that in the construction stage 
there is no 0 usage at the usage location. In my opinion, crushing the artificial zero

systems is not good in the long run. Invoicing must be possible 
also in less than a day.  
Marko: so you are flagging option 1? Pia: If the temporary model comes in a month and a half
after that, I support option 1. Marko: option 2 would come in January 
2024. Pia: However, the final decision should be made by the end of 2024 
by.  
• 
Jari: Along the same line as Pia. The final solution should be one that
at the end of 2024, preferably even in the middle of the year. Option 1, no 
temporary solution.  
• 
Christian: That's the direction (option 1) you should go. I have to start developing 
so that the systems understand partial days. Gotta start developing what 
the sooner the better. The end of 2024 as a schedule sounds possible, 
may be even a little earlier. It depends on what kind of solution is obtained from this. 
• 
Greetta: Nothing more to say, we haven't had this relationship in the system
I do challenges. Of course, ET's position was included in this (with some big challenges). Nothing new 
to add. Option 1 would be a long-term operating model. good transfer until the end of 2024
time to sleep. 
• 
Jani: The goal is to get to the 2.0 operating model (option 1) as soon as possible
man quickly. The end of 2024 can be done on schedule. 
• 
Kari: Along the same lines as earlier (option 1). Systems must be able to 
to manage the few days, can't come up with values ​​there. 
• 
Päivi: Along the same lines as before (option 1). 
• 
Summer: Preceding the trip, 1 option is where to go in the long run
I see. However, a transition is needed, a relaxation is needed first. 
• 
Mia: Option 1, the quantities are so small and there are no problems at the moment. 
• 
Niina: We also use our own unpacking solution, which we can manage with. Far 
in sight, option 1 sounds good. 
• 
Pasi: Everyone has a technical readiness. Option 1 until the end of 2024 is ok. 
• 
Pekka: As a third party, we are not affected, but the final solution may
as soon as possible. Not significant for us as a technical matter. 
• 
Petri: We do what the market wants. If customers comment on the option 
1, then that's it. The end of 2024 is a long time for system development 
as system suppliers to look at our operating model, should be able to answer 
to problems even faster.

• 
Sari: Option 1 and oroption 3 both received support. For longer
during war, you have to be able to manage invoicing even in a shed. I tick option 1 
on behalf of and the end of 2024 as a schedule ok. 
• 
Tarja: As mentioned earlier, thoughts have arisen and changed this mid-
during wetting. At this point, I would strongly think that option 1 is pi-
the most reasonable solution in the short term. There is some kind of excitement around the matter, that is 
requires us to unwind the current tension and implement a final solution. 
Transition period until the end of 2024 ok. 
• 
Jaakko: All options work, and it doesn't affect us. The most effective is to take 
taking into account the opinions of others. 
Marko continued the discussion on how to proceed with the matter. Option 1 got 
as a long-term model of support, but what are the needs of a temporary solution
i do 
• 
Pia: I hope that our system supplier would be able to handle the dismantling, that is, that there is no need
maybe even a separate temporary solution. However, it's been half a year already 
manage and should continue to manage before even getting a temporary solution.  
• 
Jari: I would put all my efforts into making a final decision as soon as possible
soon and we'll just make do with the current solution. How can development even take 
for so long (until the end of 2024). The issue should be prioritized in such a way that we get no-
soon done. 
• 
Christian: I'll beat Pia. We will be able to develop some solution and we have to leave 
to investigate how quickly a permanent solution for next year can be obtained and what is required
I'll unpack it first. Option 1 is ok for us. The system 
missing values ​​could be delivered inside in connection with invoicing, I don't know 
what a big job, but it may not be a big job. 
• 
Greetta: Nothing to add that hasn't already been said. The system can be sent via
to slow even faster than by the end of 2024. Would it be the beginning of 2024 
better? 
• 
Jani: Temporary solutions have already had to be structured in order to be able to invoice
tua Option 1 alone is the best, there is no need to go to the data hub to build a
solution because of the year. 
• 
Suvi: I don't understand the wording of the question, the end of 2024 was if we make an interim
reed solution.  
Laura elaborated: If we do not start with a temporary solution, the year 2024 is not a
reading question, because now we have to act in some way in accordance with 2.0 - for this we already have
mass demolition and other solutions to cope with the situation. On the side of the parties 
the invoicing is somehow already being processed. Marko stated that as a long-term option 
1 was found to be the best, and if we didn't even go to a temporary solution at all, 
so what timetable would be used to reach the final solutions supporting the 2.0 model for the parties
ten systems. Pia asked if the problem wasn't that after 2.0 came 
everyone should be able to bill for less than two days. These are not

the parties and system providers understood and contacted each other at this point 
to datahub that they cannot bill customers. Suvi stated that, in its current state, the problem
The trick is that end customers are led to call network companies, when everyone else 
there are no mentioned jars in use. 
• 
Kari: Nothing to add to the previous ones.  
• 
Päivi: I hope and feel that the invoicing can be handled with the help of the demolition and possible
a final solution would be reached as quickly as possible.  
Marko: so a temporary solution is not necessary?

linear solution. Option 1 is the best solution.

it can be assumed that by dismantling everything will be made to work. Option 2 for the interim period and 
after this, option 1 as the goal. 
• 
Mia: Let's get by with the current model, everyone needs to get the invoicing working. I can't sa-
noa, which systems don't bend and how long it takes to get teardown solutions. 
• 
Niina: We ourselves have a demolition solution and we can manage with it. It's not an easy thing, 
for many there are difficulties here, but if there is a final solution that we are
nossa, a temporary solution in the meantime does not make sense from DH's point of view. 
• 
Pasi: Nothing to add, I can't say anything about temporary. We talked about other-
from the same month, when the implementation could come as early as 2024. 
• 
Pekka: It is emphasized that the final solution should be able to be rushed and resolved 
situation for everyone. Until then, there are no good alternatives, but you have to go to the
with its own demolition solutions. 
• 
Petri: From our point of view, as long as it's black on white (that 1 is what 
let's go), then let's push the implementation lnot this year. 
• 
Sari: Option 2 was our recommendation as a temporary option. Exchange-
of the final schedule of condition 1, what the implementation of the DH 2.2 version is concerned with 
requires system development. I can't say that at least 2024 would be the beginning 
alright. 
• 
Tarja: From my point of view, I would prefer to only turn to option 1, i.e. the final model 
half. To what kind of actions it requires from us in order to get it permanently 
to be resolved, I can't take a stand. If we conclude that there is no interim solution
sua, the operators will work towards the final model as quickly as possible. Every 
the system supplier, in discussion with its own customers, strives to build
settlement of the country as quickly as possible. 
Jari left at 10:41.  
• 
Jaakko: We don't need any changes. We are also waiting for the contents of version 2.2 to
by the way.

Marko summed up that I would be able to manage almost everything in the situation. Marko 
asked Suvi if there should be a survey of the industry to verify the situation, or 
shall we go with this group's decision? Suvi stated that it is now necessary to act on these me-
with netelami in the datahub, we should not aim for the beginning of 2024, but work as much as possible 
quickly. Pia stated that now that the matter has been discussed in the development group, it should 
to inform the industry on the subject. Even the fastest would get a temporary one in the data hub 
unboxed model only at the beginning of 2024. Now we have also discussed the topic of system administration
with the surveyors in the sub-working group, and now it is decided that everyone strives to get an orderly
to get it in shape as quickly as possible to conform to the 2.0 model without a temporary one 
solution. Suvi stated that the sellers will therefore be provided with insufficient information from now on as well. 
Suvi also summed up that this has now been the decision of the development team and this is the way to go.  
➔ Summary of the development proposal recommendation: 
Marko summed up the discussion: The group recommended that the current model be kept and not adopted 
temporary model for use. Let's start documenting this better and send it 
newsletter on the subject and informed about decisions.

Marko stated about the development proposal, which concerned the netting calculation under construction status 
correction of object processing history (development proposal #281) that we are 
close to getting a proposed solution and informing the development work
group separately. 
• 
Tarja asked when and to what extent the content of version 2.2 would be known. Marko 
stated that there will be information in the next few weeks about matters that are sure to
lot and also about potential changes. 
• 
Tarja commented on the com-
ment in the working group. The everyday life of system suppliers is that plans are published
the swamp is made for the long term. If there are new changes, new systems will have to be
gestures to make and open the contents of the publications again. There are schedules 
very difficult to move. If the system supplier has several customers
for those who have already had to be informed of publication schedules, all changes
those who wave these plans are challenged. For example, a change in the law
such as electricity credits etc. affect the plans. Marko stated that 1.5 
at the end of a year is a long shot, but the time window of half a year is starting to ah-
das. Here you should reach somewhere in between (0.5v – 1.0v).
