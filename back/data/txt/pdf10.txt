to the party and gives instructions on the operation.  
Regarding December, the ticket processing times were found to be similar to the extended ones in November 
processing times. In the development work group, the need to prioritize tickets with an end

The development team also asked about the material from the previous week's topical webinar. 
It was stated that the material is to be published quickly, but with regard to the recordings
the county has a report on whether they will be published on the Datahub Palvelut portal in the future. center-
it was brought up that due to the current geopolitical situation, the minutes of ET's working groups 
are no longer public, but only available to working group members, and the development work group
the question was raised whether the same practice should also be considered in Datahub's development
for the working group's materials. The challenge was seen to be that it is nevertheless important for the industry 
to get information about what is happening in the development team. The matter is being reviewed internally Data-
with the hub.   
Current affairs of the development working group - Appendix 2 
Marko reviewed the development team's current issues. The use of the supplementary version of the main version 2.1
employment is on 23 February 2024. Testing of the 2.2 version starts on 18.12.2023 in the VEN02 environment and 
25.12. In the CERT02 environment.  
The list of bug fixes included in version 2.2 is planned to be published as soon as possible 
earlyfrom the year, but the exact schedule is not yet clear.

Development proposal #97, checks on customer information

addresses that use capital letters in different ways (for example, Roman numerals and 
people's names), the inspection rule cannot be implemented as it is.

Regarding foreign addresses, it was found that the format of the address is very country-specific and 
we are talking about small amounts of customers, so it is not the case for foreign addresses 
need for additional rules. The up-to-dateness of the instructions should be checked to the extent that
it mentions that zero (0) should be entered in the house number field if the house number
there is no sea.  
Summary: The instructions check the use of zero in the house number field. Other-
no new inspections are carried out. 
 
3.1.2  
Development proposal #148, Updating the text of the name and address structure instructions 
Laura presented the development proposal and the updated text of the Name and address structure guidelines. Develop
the working group liked the new text. In addition, the specification mentioned above is added to the instructions 
about the use of zero in the house number.  
Summary: A proposed update to the help text is made.  
 
3.1.3  
Development proposal #203, connection and disconnection with minute accuracy - appendix 4 
Pauliina went through the development proposal in relation to reporting the connection and disconnection to me-
tin's accuracy in order to minimize the energy remaining in network losses and prepared for this 
two solution options. 
In the development work group, it was concluded that moving to the vart takes care of a large part of the problem, and it does not 
both solution options were seen to bring additional benefits to networks and sellers in terms of cost-
compared to the pussies. In addition to Datahub, the change would also require the implementation of the systems of the parties
where and the change would not be expected until 2025/2026, when the quarter has to be transferred
rutty already more widely. In the development work group, it was concluded that ET's development work group had not
read comments about it. 
The current operating model was therefore found to be sufficient, but it was found that revision
and, if necessary, the instructions on the recommended methods of action will be specified. 
Summary: The guidelines will be revised, but otherwise the issue will not be advanced. Let's get back to this if 
need sometime later. 
 
3.2  
It requires a discussion in the working group and preliminary questions to be clarified, mi-
we want to proceed with the following development proposals. In the appendices "Data-
hub muuotoiveet 20231201" background for the discussion and questions:   
3.2.1  
Development proposal #310, exchange of contracts between clients 
Laura presented a development proposal related to a case where a customer changes their contract 
to another name, preventing disconnection. In the development group, it was stated that on Datahub's side, no 
nothing can be done about this. It's a round of the contract, but that's not the case

nothing official was mentioned, for example in the debt collection act. The parties should solve the situations
in order to start from what the terms of the contract say and, for example, demand, if necessary,

my business.  
Summary: No changes to Datahub. The parties must have their own processes in order, 
so that the cases remain in the minds of the parties and can be handled by, for example, collateral

3.2.2  
Development proposal #346, notification of contract termination to an already terminated contract
for the mus 
 
Laura reviewed development proposal #346, which presented an extension to the previously recommended one 
to development #33. The development work group concluded that in the case described in the proposal
it is about an incorrect situation, because there cannot be contracts at the same place of use 
with overlapping dates. The seller should become aware of the situation at the point when 
the customer tries to indicate the end dateend and the seller sees that the contract is already concluded
tired In this case, it is a situation where something has been declared incorrectly, and the seller has to leave 
to clarify the matter by e-mail or telephone. Datahub's side did not see any connection to this
I don't see the need for development, but #33 should be implemented as is for version 2.3. In the same 
in connection, different use cases could be described in the documentation about which situations Da-
can be handled through tahub and how to handle situations that cannot be handled through Datahub.  
Summary: No change is made to the solution, but #33 is implemented as currently planned. 
In connection with this, strengthening the guidelines on which situations can/cannot be treated with this and what
then we will act (clarification of the matter between the parties). 
 
3.3  
For the information of the development team (Datahub's internal development), concerns the development
the following points in the proposal list, the solution proposal in the appendix "Datahub other
wishes 20231201":   
3.3.1  
Development Proposal #297, Data to be submitted to EV  
Marko presented a completed list of information to be delivered to EV, which has also been requested 
EV's comment by the end of this week. In the development group, central
information about how information about the seller who is obliged to deliver is maintained in Datahub and whether 
the need to convey that information in the report, when EV also has it. It was stated that it will be checked 
this is still from Datahub's side. In addition, it was stated that it is also necessary to convey information 
billing address of the customer's previous sales contract. The first invoice is sent 
using that address and the customer can change the billing method themselves if necessary.  
Summary: Let's complete the solution description so that we also include the pre-
avoid the billing address in the sales contract. In addition, the person responsible for delivery is still being checked 
vendor maintenance in Datahub and the need to include the information in the report.

For the information of the development team, the improvements made to the versions of the CMS product 
2.2/2.3, applies to the following points in the list of development proposals, the solution proposal attached
in "Datahub change requests 20231201": - Appendix 5 
Marko presented the development proposals #21, #24, #77 and #323, which are becoming CMS product pa-
as rants in versions 2.2/2.3. Regarding proposal #24, it was clarified that both the seller and 
it should be possible for the network to retrieve everything except the measurement data
messages.

Self-evaluation of the development team's activities – Appendix 6 
Marko went through the preliminary answers given for the self-evaluation, and the development team did 
the results of the discussion and the working group's activities. The development working group stated that the working group 
the activity has developed in a good direction and the discussions in the working group about different cases 
were felt to be really important. With the composition of the group, different views come along 
and experiences that also bring knowledge to other group members. The development team also stated, 
that the materials prepared in advance have been good, but as far as possible 
there could be more examples of the problem and information about its extent. Also operational
model, where everyone is asked for recommendations/comments, has been found to work also in
in terms of getting to know each other and handling things. 
Some of the group members felt that it has been challenging to get comments on the preparation of the topics 
internally and from stakeholders, even when it comes to important issues. In addition, some experienced the implemented
to maintain the low response rates of the respondents, as these offer the industry an opportu-
den affects things. On the other hand, the group also had opposite experiences and topics 
there are many enthusiastic participants in the preparation. Preparing topics requires time and effort
the aim is to have the material of the meetings published earlier so that the participants will have time 
as much time as possible to prepare for the topics of the meetings.   
Challenges were also seen in the fact that after the development work group's discussion, things progress slowly
again, and with regard to the recommended proposals, it is not known in which version the implementation will be. 
However, the growth of the team on the Datahub system supplier side should start 
also appear in the design for future versions, in which case the situation in this regard will improve
no. In addition to this, with regard to unprocessed development proposals, there is no visibility into 
when these will be processed. To improve the situation, it was agreed that in the meetings 
we will also begin to spend time going through the list of development proposals together, so that we can
with careful preparation, you can identify e.g. issues affecting priority and possible fear of
cases treated with this guideline.  
In addition, the development group expressed the wish to include ET in the activity at least
I created whenthere are issues on the agenda that also concern ET.

Other things  
In the development work group, there was a discussion about the change in the Electricity Market Act and the timetables 
regarding the report to be submitted to EV (development proposal #297) and the comparison of electricity consumption
for presenting data in the end customer portal (development proposal #280). Report and comparison 
for the customer's consumption of the previous year, it is planned to put into production on June 1, 2024 the
in it. The comparison of the customer's consumption with the corresponding end user group is an open topic, 
because the comparison criteria have not yet been confirmed. At the moment it seems that compar-
the information that may be required by the bone is not available in Datahub or in the parties' own 
in systems. A comment on the matter has been requested from EV by the end of week 51.
