Datahub documentation: Time zone usage
•
In the current DH process documentation, it is mentioned: "The information contained in the basic data of the place of use 
about the time zone gives the seller the necessary information when choosing the product of the sales contract for the customer". This is not for everyone 
regarding the parties, interpret exactly correctly, but regarding hourly metered usage locations, the network supplies each kp with a time zone 
1 although e.g. a network product is billed with 2 or 3 pieces of information (day/night or season). This causes problems for sellers if any 
confirmed to the customer the time zone of the network to be followed.

Documentation update proposal: "The information about the time zone of the place of use in the basic information of the place of use gives the seller 
necessary information when choosing the product of the sales contract for the customer. The indicated time zone information should match the network 
product."
