Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision 
2.1  
Recommendation from the working group (whether items are recommended for further development process
in), applies to the following points in the list of development proposals, the solution proposal attached
in "Datahub change requests 20240109":  
2.1.1  
#271 - Annual usage estimate update  
Laura presented the proposal prepared in the development work group regarding the daily
according to which the annual usage estimate would be updated to Datahub once a year  
starting one year after a new contract has been announced for the place of use. The purpose is to change 
guidelines and practices for updating the annual usage estimate, in order to ensure that the data remains
up to date. Regarding Datahub, it is a change in the guidelines, and there is no Datahub 
the intention is to build new functionality related to the change, such as updating
related blocks or reminders about missing updates.  
The change was considered good, but with the discussion, the guidelines needed clarification.
hide There was a discussion about the amount of updates according to the proposal and their Datahu-
of the burden caused to Bille, because on certain days, for example at the beginning of the year,
massive amounts (hundreds of thousands) of contracts. The working group considered the possibility of
distributes the updates so that the systems of the parties distribute them according to certain rules, e.g.
kiksi +/- for a period of one week from the start of the contract, when the load would be received evenly
help with possible peak moments. It was stated that Datahub's side is reviewing the contract
the timing of the starts and analyze their effect on performance, based on
we are thinking about the instructions on the possible distribution of updates in more detail. Oh-
if necessary, the issue will still be brought to the attention of the sub-working group.  
It was also stated in the working group that in terms of change, it is essential that the annual usage estimate 
for updating, a limited DH-122 message is used, which is used to update only the annual
vio when there is no need to update other information related to the place of use. In this case Datahub 
also forwards only the updated annual usage estimate to the seller, and not all information about the place of use
toja, which reduces the amount of data to be transmitted. The group concluded that in all
in jestelmi it is not necessarily implemented to send only the annual usage estimate, but 
it is important to have this in order when updates start to be made more regularly. In addition 
it was stated that the guidelines must also take into account other cases in which the annual
the bug is being updated. In addition to the contract-related update, an annual usage estimate must be kept 
updated, for example, in connection with a change in fuse size. Concerns were raised in the group
I also like the fact that there will be no annual usage estimate in connection with the announcement of the new contract 
update or reset, but the old onethe estimate must remain until the end of the year
tua will be sent an updated annual usage estimate. The discussion also addressed the proposal Data-
about the possibility of calculating the annual usage estimate for the hub, but it was stated that currently
it is in the Electricity Market Act about the task that falls under the responsibility of the distribution system operator.  
The group also brought up the line from ET that the annual usage estimate will include 
use the value used in invoicing, i.e. possibly netted or energy community
cell value instead of the measured value. It was noted that this is likely to require changes 
in the systems of several parties, but it is important that everyone has access to the same thing 
data-based annual usage estimate. Information on the use of the invoiced value in the annual usage estimate 
will also be added to Datahub's documentation.

Summary: The change in the update practice of the annual usage estimate received the support of the group. 
The impact on performance is being investigated on Datahub's side and the guidelines will be updated accordingly 
based on other comments raised in the group. Instructions are still needed-
essa again to the sub-working group before its publication. Because the change in the annual usage estimate
at a fast pace and taking into account the invoiced value requires system development in almost all
for all parties, time must be reserved for adapting to the change.  
2.1.2  
#293 - Managing site concurrency information  
Laura presented the development proposal regarding the netting and the parallel data of the place of use 
management problems in situations where one of the netting locations is 
deactivated. In version 2.2, a new validation rule is added to Datahub, which prevents the
preventing error situations from occurring in the future, and old error situations can be corrected 
after the implementation of previously discussed development proposal #276 in a later version of
in part. Datahub's documentation currently has an incorrectly described inspection rule 
for process DH-127, according to which correction of those errors would not be possible #276 
along, but there is an error in the documentation in this regard, as the rule in question is not used in DH-
In the 127 process. Consequently, the problem of the development proposal will be solved by the aforementioned
with the changes and Datahub's side is only required for this proposal 
documentation correction. The sub-working group had no comments on the matter. 
Summary: Correcting Datahub's documentation for an incorrect inspection rule.  
2.2  
It requires a discussion in the working group, preliminary questions to find out how 
we want to resolve the following development proposals. In the appendix "Datahub other
tostoiveet 20240109" background for discussion, alternatives and questions
it:   
2.2.1  
#176 - Transmission of netting information to the distribution system operator 
Laura presented the netting information of the place of use set by Datahub in connection with the development proposal 
for transmission to the distribution system operator. A previously discussed and abandoned topic was deemed necessary 
to re-examine proposal #276 discussed in the previous sub-working group meeting 
(correction of parallelism data in the past) with.  
Of the solution options, the majority supported the first option, according to which Da-
tahub would always send the distribution network operator an E58-type message DH-126- and DH-127-
processes. The group also suggested another type of message, such as for example 
the use of E66, in which case the message could be directed directly to the measurement data system
country instead of ATJ. However, it was found that this would require a completely new message type, 
because E66 is a measurement data message and cannot be used to transmit this type of data.  
However, the necessity of Sanoma sparked a discussion in the group, and some saw Datahub's
still necessary for flat information, but the distribution system operators who were present in the group 
stated that there is no longer any need for them, because the matter has already been resolved otherwise, e.g. 
by identifying possible error situations and increasing own error monitoring. This one 
therefore, the new messages were not seen to bring relief to problems related to netting 
causing unnecessary costs due to the implementation they require. Although the proposal does not

received support from the distribution system operators present, the group concluded that there is a reason 
to find out in more detail whether other distribution system operators still have a need for messages.  
Summary: Don survey for distribution system operators, with which to find out the need for option 1 
for the corresponding new messages.

Development of business documentation/instructions for customer information management – 
annexes 2, 3, 4 and 6 
Marjut Huotari presented the proposed changes to Datahub's business documentation 
for the development of customer information management. The following observations emerged from the review of the sub-working group
requirements and further changes to the instructions: 
1. References could be added to the documentation to ensure that all relevant instructions
deflections must be taken into account. For example, the format of the addresses is given as Nimi- and 
in the address structure instruction and it would be good if this was referenced from the Events document. 
2. Prohibition on automatic processing of transactions added to the Events document (pre-
as a sign in chapter 4.1 "Customer data update should not be sent automatically min-
return the event forwarded by datahub to the party, such as customer data 
based on the update request (DH-112-2/DH-113-2)") sparked a discussion in the group 
about the purpose of the prohibition and the proposed wording. It was stated in the group that here 
form, the instruction prohibits the automatic processing of all customer data update requests
lyn, but this doesn't work especially for large players with large masses of
kia, but automatic approval of relevant change requests should be allowed. 
The need for the ban was seen in the fact that the seller is not allowed to automatically send his own information 
(without any requested changes) to Datahub in response to a response from another party 
to the update request. Events must also not be automatically triggered by something else 
on the basis of an event, such as, for example, a new sales contract (DH-311)
as a result of the delayed message. It was concluded that there is a need to specify the guidelines so that, 
that the parties are not completely prohibited from automatic customer data update requests 
processing.   
3. In the business processes document, it was deemed necessary to further specify the business
contract-specific address to be notified to the customer. The business customer's contract will 
indicate the address of the company's office as the contract-specific invoicing address, 
to which the contract applies.  
4. Instructions only provided by contact persons necessary for the transmission of information
that's why Datahub was perceived as unclear. The instructions must specify which connection
the information must be reported to Datahub. 
5. A mention has been added to the business processes document regarding the update of contracts, 
that the update should not automatically cause another event, such as for example 
updating the customer's mailing address, unless the information has changed in that regard as well. 
Corresponding instructions were hoped to be added to the document also for updating customer information

to the relevant chapter (currently, the instructions can only be found in the Transaction
from the mat document). 
6. The changes to the name and address structure instructions include incorrect information, which
the contract confirmation would also be sent to the customer's postal address. Online service
according to the contract confirmation is sent to the customer's billing address or otherwise
to the address agreed with the customer.  
7. The party's own ID is written incorrectly on page 68 of Appendix 3. 
8. The reference to the outdated JHS 106 postal code has been removed from the name and address structure instructions
to the address guide, where from the examples used and Datahub's instructions, housing
A question has arisen for /bostad information. This will be dealt with as a separate matter 
(#374) at the next development group meeting.  
9. Attention was also raised to the guidance related to the measurement data, which cannot be found in all aspects 
From the Datahub documentation. Some of the instructions are only published in the newsletter or given 
in response with a ticket. It was agreed that Samuli Saine would put information on the applications
of the pursuits and Datahub's side will check the instructions and take the information to the official 
to the documentation.  
Summary: Fingrid edits the business documentation based on the comments given
jalta and they will then be published for the entire industry to view.

The industry of the 8 recommended development proposals of the meeting of the development working group
comments – appendix 5 
Laura went through the comments from the industry on the business specifications regarding the development
from dot #57 (handling contracts when connecting).  
Regarding the need for transmission of the connection message to a third party, discussed in the comments
it was stated to Lelle that the need will be investigated separately. 
The working group also had a discussion about the message included in the proposal of the distribution network
to the holder, which according to the received comment was seen as unnecessary. In the group it was found that
I did, thatä message is necessary, because with the change Datahub will be on the side 
more reasoning logic in relation to switching situations, whereby the message ensures that ver-
ko and the seller have the same information, and there is no need to build reasoning in the heads of the parties.

Change 
Regarding the content of version 2.3, information about the changes affecting the industry is to be published 
during February 2024. The version update will be done in October-November 2024.

Next meeting times 
Future meeting times have not yet been agreed, because currently the sub-working group's
there are no specific cases open. The next meeting will be held during the spring if necessary, but 
the date will be agreed later when the schedules of the meetings of the development work group come 
are clear. The working group expressed the wish that in the future the meetings would start at 10 a.m., 
so that participation on the spot would also be possible for those traveling further afield.
