Development proposal #58 
Laura Markkanen presented the development proposal and its solution description. Marko 
stated that the views of the parties on the proposal are hoped for, whether this is possible
is it a matter to be resolved with instructions or are system changes required? 
Niina Leikas asked what is the disconnection notice, which is meant here? Laura full-
densi that it is a DH-420 event. Niina further specified what is here 
the thing that causes the problem in events? 
Kirsi Jylhä stated that they have had the problem in question on a part of the network 
in connection with temporary connections and for these, it has been done so that the place of use 
is first set to cut-off mode and only then the agreement to remove the meter is concluded 
in connection with. Now they have been instructed on the correct course of action in those situations, i.e. so-
the pimuses are finished first and only then set to cut. 
Päivi Karppanen said that they did not identify the problem situations in question and 
they have not occurred. 
Niina asked if the cut-off mode is correct at all in those situations? Cherry full-
densi, that according to their information, this has always been the case. Niina said that the space
in the case of head connections, the "under construction" status would certainly be a more correct way to operate, and not 
sets the target to disconnected state. 
Jari Arve added that such situations are rare for them as well. 
Suvi Manninen, asked if the seller could further specify what the
nassa causes the actual problem? How does the activity in question change in practice
itchy at the sellers? Are certain processes, for example, connected to cut-
to happen, even if in this situation it shouldn't be like that? 
Pia Aaltonen asked if the dates could also cause a problem here? Eg-
kikis termination will be announced earlier and the contract announcement will only come later
for which day? In the seller's processes, incorrect status information of the place of use could affect
for example, whether the basic fee can be invoiced. 
Suvi comments that at least they haven't become aware of any problems with the space in question
of you. There may be a slight delay in the notification of events and disconnection notifications 
leave for a larger number of destinations at once. The handling of the case could also be 
ET development group thing. 
Pia wondered if the problem is caused by the fact that there is a longer delay between events? Pi-
dempi delay can cause manual work for sellers and if notifications come 
for example on different days. 
Kirsi added that for a certain network, the builder first announces that the object has been disconnected 
- mode. This information is forwarded to the next party, which informs the subject of the agreement
set to end. In this case, the delaythat it can take even more days.

Pia commented that the situations should be delivered according to the current data hub processes
either. Suvi commented that there is currently no notification of the events in question 
no time limits specified. 
Marko asked how it would be possible to add time limits to processes at this point or 
what kind of validations would be needed? Suvi commented that adding validation 
feels challenging in this situation. It is not possible to conclude from the disconnection notice alone 
should the termination notice come from this within a certain time limit, interruptions will be announced 
also in other connections. 
Laura comments that it is still possible to find out whether the problem here is caused by 
that the events come with too long a delay, or would the situation work correctly if ta-
incidents are reported, for example, during the same day. Could the problem be caused by
also guarantees if the events are announced during the same day, but in different order
in it. 
Marko stated that the background of the situation in question and the problem in more detail will be investigated 
the reason in more detail before proceeding with the matter. The group members combined
here and more detailed information about the background must be obtained before it can be done

Suvi presented the development proposal and Laura the solution description, which was that no 
start making changes according to the development proposal. 
Niina asked for further clarification, whether it's about the network and the seller seeing 
possible reasons for cancellation also in connection with these? It would be good to be more specific 
the reasons are also visible. Suvi added that yes, more specific reasons for both 
should be equally visible. The development proposal is during the project phase 
and no longer see it as necessary. 
Next, the members' view of the proposal and its progress was reviewed:

Development proposal #110 
Suvi presented the development proposal and the members had a few additional questions
mush. 
Pia asked if it is the case that the network has to manually handle the decision every time
canceling it? Suvi commented that no, you should automatically go to the main
at least they have.  
Kirsi commented that this was a problem for them at one point, but the situation improved
divided  Pia asked if manual repairs can still catch those situations, 
where the decision was later made again for a different day? Kirsi commented, 
that we mainly only get a couple of situations encountered where definitive information is obtained

datahub should become information about the final situation of the contract, especially if the seller 
made several consecutive mnews about the contract situation in a short time. 
Marko also stated that it is a change of 1 size class. We visited next

• 
Development proposal #131 
Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description. 
Niina asked for clarification, is it the case that the DH-311-4 event would only start if
it has a different seller? Should the event also start in a situation where the seller is 
the same, but the customer is different? These situations can certainly come up. The customer doesn't always 
understand that consumption and production objects are separate and must be agreed upon
others separately. 
Pia clarified that this situation still needs to be described in the proposal and solution
cast along. The event must go if the seller is the same, but the customer is different. 
Marko and Laura said that this will be further specified in the presentation and need
its possible effect on the cost estimate is still being investigated.  
Next, the members' view of the proposal and its progress was reviewed:

• 
Development proposal #160 
Jenni Mäkinen presented the development proposal and its solution description. 
Suvi commented that basically, when we change the operation so that the processing 
moves from e-mails completely to the system, proposals must also be reviewed 
in the sub-working group. This will also require changes in the systems of the parties, 
therefore, comments and observations on workload and impact should also be collected systematically
from editors. There is also a need to write down how the operator's cancellation goes pro-
in the session mind and how the parties must interpret this. For example, in which situations 
will the previous agreement be reinstated? Now the e-mail contains all the necessary information explana-
can be done, but how do the situations correspond to the interpretation of the message. Will it be needed in the future? 
however, check separately from the user interface. The hope would be that no review would be needed 
separately, but the message would cover everything needed. 
Jari, asked if it is a problem that will go away and if the quantities will decrease? 
Jenni commented that at first it was thought that this would only apply to migration
many contracts. However, this has not been the case. Almost half of datahub's customer service
the daily work of velu consists of dealing with these situations. 
Pia also commented that as a temporary relief to the situation, it is hoped that
I will provide clearer instructions in situations of contract cancellation and termination. Soon 
commented that, at least in their system, customers can go themselves
to move out, but this has now also been incorrectly used for cancellations. 
This causes false terminations and cancellations and thus leads to ticket data-
to the hub. 
Jenni commented that answers to detailed questions were received from ET last week.
regarding certain cancellation situations. These will be taken into account in the guidelines
in the near future. 
Next, the members' view of the proposal and its progress was reviewed: 
Päivi: I understand the need and the matter should be handled well, we support it 
Pekka: absolutely necessary and will have an impact on the parties' systems 
review in the sub-working group, is supported 
Pia: it is supported and the effects on the systems of the parties must be ensured  
Kirsi: supported

• 
Development proposal #140 
Marko presented the development conditionand its solution description. To the development proposal 
there were no further questions or comments from the group. 
Pia asked if the report in question is also available to the parties? Marko said, 
that basically the report is created only for datahub's needs, its visibility 
the parties did not know how to verify this point and the matter will be returned later
hell 
Suvi commented that size class vs. impact does not meet in this proposal. 
Marko added that it is a small size class 2 or a large size class 1 
change. Suvi commented that more detailed instructions are coming from the Energy Industry
situation in which the seller's activities stop completely. Would this proposal 
go through only in this context? 
Marko added that the draft of the instruction in question has been taken into account as part of the solution criteria
and is taken into account as part of the totality of the situations in question.  
Pia comments on whether mass functionality is used here only in situations where 
when a party goes bankrupt? Marko comments that yes, this is operationally
the mouth would basically be used only in these situations. Pia commented if she could 
this is also used in situations where a party sells its operations and they would combine
with another operator? Marko stated that there is no direct answer to this and this 
can be further specified and clarified. Checked after meeting: 
This has been discussed in a previous process working group and it was concluded that 
mass termination is used in sudden fault situations. Otherwise, we proceed to
contrary to the basic principles of the country's data hub and a decision is made between the parties 
on behalf of.  
 
Suvi commented that this proposal is only related to producing the report better 
information, and does not directly affect the conclusion of the contracts themselves. Marko added that 
holds its place and the actual decision-making has its own separate proposal (#141).

Niina stated that Pia's previous comment was good and making decisions 
mass driving would facilitate operations in these situations as well. Customers would have more 
time to enter into possible new agreements when the decisions are made in time. 
Next, the members' view of the proposal and its progress was reviewed: 
Kirsi: The price for the development of the report alone is high, be careful if you get
to be included as part of a larger development 
Pia: Now the proposals related to the larger whole have been broken down into smaller
silicon parts, are the proposal separate at all functional? Shall we make fear-
with this report, nothing if the proposal regarding the decision itself is not successful? Va-
very nice yes. 
Marko added that the matter will be dealt with as a whole, the individual eh-
grants move the whole thing forward step by step. 
Pekka: careful yes. Basically, tools are needed that can be used 
handles mass drives, business bankruptcies and deals. As a separate proposal 
the development of one report gets a lot of attention. Careful yes, but the point 
must act as a whole. 
Päivi: Careful, yes, now it makes it difficult to visualize the whole, when 
things broken into parts. As a whole, these should be carried forward. 
Kari: careful yes 
Mia: careful yes 
Summer: not recommended, the workload of the report alone is large, the need for use and
ratio does not match. The correction of the report could be implemented, for example, simply by 
robot, and there would be no need to change the code behind the report itself. 
Niina: It's difficult to comment as a single separate proposal, things 
in principle, you should act in these situations, but be careful 
Jari: It's important to see the whole thing first, the total cost and how 
changes can be bundled here. Could you just fix the report 
fixed by a robot? Careful yes. 
The development working group gave cautious support to the proposal, but it is still needed 
a more accurate total cost estimate.  
Marko stated that the issue is being promoted through the whole and we are trying to get more 
cost estimate, so that the whole of the changes can be understood better.  
Jari stated that it would be good to go through the possibilities of using the robot in other ways
in some situations, you don't go primarily to make changes to the code of the reports themselves

Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description.  
Pia asked if the contract is terminated with the reason "End of activity of the seller", if it prevents 
this thatcanceling any future contract does not restore the previous one 
terminated the seller's contract? Laura said, yes, that's how it would work. 
Pia commented that this did not come out directly from the solution description. Laura full-
densi to add this even more precisely to the solution description. 
Pia also asked if there is a corresponding 14-day period for the next one 
regarding the seller's contract? Laura also stated that yes, here the nor-
goals process deadlines. 
Suvi also comments that it is difficult to grasp the whole when the potential for change
the allowances are separate. Is it possible to visit the whole for these yet 
through and also look at its price tag? 
Marko said that a total of five have been noticed regarding the seller's sudden termination 
separate need for change. These will be reviewed as a whole and
I guarantee a more accurate cost estimate with each proposal.  
Suvi also said that going through this whole thing in this group is important, 
in order to better understand the changes required by the case as a whole and whether 
possibly some other things that should be included. 
Pekka also commented that there are other possible variations than business
bankruptcies or transactions that would be considered here? Will cover these changes as well 
other possible situations where mass functions may be used. Soon 
added that there was a case in the fall where the party did not immediately stop the full
sest, but first told the customers to get a new salesperson, because they are going to stop-
terrestrial. 
Niina asked whether it is available, even though messages are sent to network companies about decisions 
also a report on the objects for which the decision has been made in these situations? Network port-
it would be necessary to get a separate report from nalta on these items. otherwise decisions 
can get lost among other termination events. Also customer contact
acting in these situations would be easier based on the report. Report on decisions and 
of the canceled items would be necessary in this situation. 
Suvi also comments that when ET's instruction on acting in termination situations comes, pi-
to examine whether these changes meet the needs presented in the instructions in all respects. 
For example, would there be other reports that would be necessary here?  
Marko commented that the whole has already been examined according to ET's proposed guidelines
against nature, but we will still verify that all the necessary actions
nalities and reports can be implemented. 
Jari stated that these changes are absolutely necessary. Also the overall
the price tag should become known so that the need for changes can be evaluated
bomb against this too. We definitely want to eliminate manual work 
in these situations. If, on the other hand, the price tag becomes large, the amount of work will increase

Development proposal #164 
Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description.  
Suvi asked what history is behind the current delimitation? 
Laura said that the exact history of this cut is not known.

The development group supported the proposal unanimously. 
The following development proposal has already been discussed in the group a couple of times before. The suggestion is 
once discussed in the sub-working group as well. The proposal requires discussion in a working group, 
how do you want to solve the next development proposal, do you want to introduce a new sa-
nama. In the attachments "Datahub change requests 20221202" and "Change proposal #57 message"

Development proposal #57 and #104 (contract process, related to #57 discussion) 
Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description. Marko completed 
also that the goal is certainly that the information is up-to-date and that automation is used
as far as possible. 
Pia comments that, basically, the new message is not a good thing. This subject-
guarantees work in the parties' own systems, which takes more time. Summer full of
densi, that the idea of ​​the original solution proposal for this development proposal was 
only changing the logic in the background, and the change would not cause additional actions on the part of the parties.

new message. The addition of a new message would also require processing by the development team 
in the sub-working group. 
Pia and Suvi both commented that the proposal has now escalated from the original
from that idea of ​​change. Pia hoped that instead of a new message, they would return to the idea 
about the addition of new state information for renovation sites. 
Suvi comments that, compared to the previous one, it has now gone further when it is presented 
new message. Based on the last discussions, at first it was only necessary to specify 
and complements the presented logic regarding the processing of the contract's start date. 
Piia added that based on the last review, there was no need for new ones 
for messages. 
Laura stated that the background for the idea of ​​a new message was that the party cannot 
now information about the contract date change. The party does not receive information where 
in situations where there is a change of status in Structures → Connected has changed the start date of the contract
flow and where not. This is presumably essential information for the parties if the state
the change will cause a change in the start date of the contract. 
Marko also asked how information about the change would be updated for the parties? Summer comment
brought that the changes would come to the attention of the parties in the same way as in the current pro-
sessions and at least they have built their own reasoning for this. Marko stated that 
the same reasoning could be done with a new message for all parties involved in the operation of the data hub
place. In this way, uniform action would be ensured for all parties. 
Miia commented that for them the addition of the new message did not affect the preliminary
from a large increase on the basis of teasing. Marko also stated that if necessary say-
implementation/commissioning can be staggered to a later date if necessary, i.e. not
so the change of the head of the datahub is made. 
Suvi also brought up under-construction places of use regarding the fact that datahub 2.0 
in the version, the validation of the measurement data has changed for the under-construction objects 
regarding and currently no measurement data is accepted for them at all. This already leads 
now to the fact that the items temporarily under construction will be billed 
to fail because measurement data cannot be delivered to them. The organization of the parties
the terms require measurement data for the entire contract period so that the items can be calculated
to itch. 
Minna Luojus added that the validation in question has come in the datahub 2.0 version, 
but the validation should have been included already in the 1.9.0 version (but it is incorrectly 
missing). In addition, there have been suggestions and comments on the subject in both directions
so, some networks do not wish to deliver measurement data to objects under construction, 
for some this is ok and necessary. For items currently under construction
Of course, there is no measurement data for you, but there is for them in such situations 
generated a series of zeros. 
Suvi commented that already due to the change in the start date of the contract
brings similar invoicing problems, because measurement data is now not available for the entire contract
for its first day, but the connection from the moment.

Pia commented that the matter should also be examined from the point of view of the restructuring situation. Now 
measurement data cannot be provided for objects under construction. For renovation participants,
you need to get a set of zeros so that the items can be invoiced and the measurement data is full 
for the duration of the contract. Processing of an object under renovation in different processes 
and in terms of measurement data should be looked at even more closely. Under construction - order -
the processing of that object would remain as it is now, and this would correspond to the concept of new objects
hit what it was designed for in the first place. 
Pekka commented that for case 3, a new 'under renovation' status will be added. 
The other cases presented would work with current processes. Pia emphasized that say-
in raus there is a need to add status information that really describes it. However, here it remains 
it is still possible that the under construction status is still being misused. Update the situation 
clearly descriptive status information is necessary and clarifies the operation. Here you can 
still instructs separately on the use of correct status information. 
Päivi commented that everything possible has been postponed under the "under construction" status 
variations, but in practice it has now been noticed that this does not work. 
Minna and Marko asked if the need for delivery of measurement data should be reviewed again 
for the first day of the contract, when the place of use is moved under construction -
from switched on? Such as thesemeasurement data cannot now be delivered to these targets for the entire agreed
for the first day, but from the moment of connection onwards.  
Suvi commented that they have created measurement data in such situations, such as
for the days in Konais, i.e. for the subject under construction, a series of zeros has been generated 
as necessary so that the items can be invoiced. Marko commented again, whether he would 
in these situations, it is possible to produce the necessary zero series by the data hub. 
In addition, there is a need to find out how many parties invoicing require measurement data 
for whole days during the entire contract period. Are we talking about everyone or e.g.
find only one system supplier. 
Päivi comments whether the validation that has now been imported can be canceled, i.e. would it be possible-
also delivery of measurement data to still-under-construction sites? Minna com-
brought that in practice this would only be the removal of this one validation rule, i.e. complete
that's a possible solution if that's what you want. Let's find out the background to this in more detail 
for the validation rule and the possibilities for its deletion. 
Marko stated that the proposal will be taken to the sub-working group for processing the new one presented 
with regard to the status information 'under renovation' and is still considered an alternative solution 
update of the change logic of the contract start date and the presented new sa-
noma for notification of change. We also carefully go through the validation of the measurement data 
in different situations, as well as the need for measurement data to be brought in 'under construction' situations as well
for that item, for the first day of the contract. 
Mia commented that it is important to take the presented solutions and alternatives to the sub-working group 
for processing. 
The following development proposals were given to the development team (datahub internal development
ty), applies to the following items in the development proposal list, the solution proposal in the appendix "Datahub 
change wishes 20221202":

Development proposal #182, (Fingrid) 
Minna presented the development proposal and its solution description. No to the proposal 
received comments or questions from the group. 
• 
Development proposal #183, (Fingrid) 
Minna presented the development proposal and its solution description. 
Pia asked if, in practice, there has been a child's process definition in these
regarding the situations? Minna and Marko commented that yes, no in the definitions 
all different situations have been taken into account sufficiently precisely and thus the concept of the balance sheet agreement
tely has still remained incomplete in certain situations.

Streamlining the tools/practices related to the work of the development team 
Marko went through the work to be started, the aim of which is to smooth the development
the working group's activities and make it more transparent. Meetings are arranged for the parties
nin's interview regarding the group's activities and the development of its activities. Over here 
three industry members of the group will be included and can indicate their willingness 
For Marko later. 
• 
"Timely" delivery of materials to the development team one week before the meeting
whence 
It is suggested that in the future the materials be delivered a week before the meeting. 
The group supported the proposal, they have time to go through the material in a week, but this time-
the limit must be adhered to. 
Suvi also asked when the action for the group regarding the quality of customer data 
start? Marko answered that internal preparation has started and this will be put into motion
in January 2023 and invitations to the group's meetings will be sent
as soon as possible, so that it can also be included in the members' calendars on time. 
• 
Netting included at the beginning of the year (Summer) 
Suvi also pointed out that they hope for more detailed instructions for netting and production
in connection with notifications of contracts for high-quality products. The matter is taken into account and this is
with detailed instructions. 
The place of production use can only be included in the netting in parallel with the place of use
from the day following the notification of the event. It would be good if you also use
the workplace agreement would start on the same day as the netting. Otherwise, the contract has 
days when netting is not valid. 
• 
Cost estimates for development proposals (Mia) 
Mia brought up the wish that had already been raised in the development group earlier, that the cost value
the fault would be refined and possibly more steps would be added in the future

for costs. This would clarify the evaluation of the costs of the proposals to the current col-
compared to a stepwise scale. We considered an option where2 and 3 of the current ones 
a new dividing level will appear between the levels. 
Pekka comments on whether it is possible to get a view and follow-up of the development group
about the costs of the change proposals I support. Marko comments that this
law can begin to be formed, it must always be noted that it is always a matter of
estimate, and it is not yet the actual costs. In addition, the cost 
will not go immediately from that year's budget, probably only when the change progresses 
and it will be carried through in practice. In addition, changes can of course still trickle down
fuck off.
