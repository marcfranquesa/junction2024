discussed. As a company, Fortum has tried to run a different model than it was in the beginning 
suggested. Marko stated that there have been rumors, but since no official information has come, 
so we proceed according to the current model.  
Marko reviewed the material of Wednesday's webinar and the scheduling of electrical support. Peter 
Juhala asked if there was no mention in the article that "at last" in the April installment, are 
prepared for the fact that they can pay the first installment as soon as the law enters into force. 
From Syneral's point of view, this would mean that the first batch would be able to be exported 
through in March, which would mean that the second installment should be passed in April, which 
DH's schedule plan is currently not possible, so it's a wording difference 
Regarding DH's materials. Marko comments that there is a discussion about the 2nd installment 
regarding the schedule, how it could still be adjusted.  
Marko stated that the definition has started and the goal is to complete the implementation 
around mid-March for FG's internal testing. In Wednesday's webinar 
there was a wish that it would be good to be ready for production use already 1–2 weeks earlier than now 
completion assessment. Marko emphasized that trial use is nevertheless important with production information, 
because it is still impossible to go through all possible test scenarios internally 
in the tests. Petri commented that there is no comment on the schedule, there is on the implementation model 
a lot to comment on. 
Jani Pasanen would like to ask if someone needs a specific role in relation to requesting a report 
from the datahub or will the usual seller roles work? Can, for example, the system provider 
to apply, or does the seller have to apply and pass on? Marko stated that it is now 
designed so that the seller applies and forwards as needed. Jani asked 
about trial use, whether it is done with real production data? Marko commented that yes, this 
is the easiest way to find out the different scenarios and their functionality. Jani commented 
regarding the schedule, that if the production is received on 1.5. from the materials, so it is quite 
short time for invoicing, which is usually done approx. by the 5th of the month, 
Jani supports the possibility of bringing the schedule forward. Marko commented that the schedule 
is already tough, but goals can of course be set. 
In the materials, Marko went to the format of the csv file, not the format itself 
received comments. Petri wondered why it is not possible to search for information through the interface 
this was such a big development effort. There is resource consumption when searching manually 
by the seller, is really employment. Petri thought that it would have been possible, for example 
with authorizations to search for time series of certain moments when the sales company's resources would not be available 
had to use tto courage. Marko asked Jan Loman about the workload on the interface, Jan 
comments that it sounds reasonable, but can't say yet about the workload. Peter stated, 
that you don't want to go and push through anything, but let's go with what is given, but 
so this is one option. Samuli Saine commented that someone from Datahub stated that this 
there would be no time series data, i.e. rotation through the measurement database is not possible, 
has it turned out that there would be hourly data? Marko comments that nothing has changed. 
Samuli stated that it does not make much sense to recycle through the measurement information system. 
Marko stated that we will go according to the terms of the schedule, but the interface can be evaluated 
possible impact on workload. 
Marko reviewed the structure and content of the report. Pia asked what if the customer is still there 
co. in the seller's sale, but the contract ID has changed along the way? These will be 
when contract corrections have to be made. In Pia's opinion, this is very basic,

which must be able to be processed. Christian commented that at that point there should be time series 
already okay. Pia commented that if the customer changed to the seller for January 
between, currently the refunds for the second set are determined from November to December. Marko 
comment that yes, the energies come from there. Pia stated that the seller still needs 
the energies of November-December, that you can refund them to the customers of batch 2. Could it be that 
does the change in the contract ID mean that the hub no longer recognizes this? Laura said, 
that the idea is based on the seller at the end of January, in which case the material would arrive at the end of January 
according to the contract code. Pia stated that these can be used with a location code 
target, but brings a challenge when the location ID and contract ID combination 
no longer face each other. Pia commented that because of GDPR issues, apparently here 
personal identification number cannot be used. Pia stated that of course she doesn't want a refund 
refers to a contract that has already ended, but must be concluded on the contract that is 
valid at that time. Pia directed the question to the system suppliers. Christian 
comment that anything extra adds work, but presumably these 
(changes in contract codes) there is not a huge amount. Pia referred to it 
to the discussion that took place in the development group (emigration-talking), so no more 
talk about individual contract corrections, but the customers do these themselves. Very 
it would be easiest to join Pia if the personal identification number and 
location ID.  
Jani asked what if the customer has already moved out, how does this work then? What 
then, if the customer has two different sellers, i.e. term, who does the report go to? What if 
have there been several contracts for the same or different seller? What if there is no longer a seller on 31.1. 
day (moved out and left without a seller)? Marko stated that it is preliminary 
the logic for various scenarios has been considered, but the logic has not yet been reviewed 
prepared in this working group. Laura stated that the presentation has described all the 
solution for situations. Pia stated that some customers may not have a salesperson on 31.1. 
day at all (has announced moving out on, for example, 28.1.), but the seller is on, for example, 1.2. 
on the day Marko stated that such a customer is excluded from these refund situations. Laura 
your sum to collect all the scenarios in one list.  
Tarja Teroheimo thought that the customer has several contracts for several different places of use 
with sellers. The data is supposed to be specific to the place of use, shouldn't the situation be 
so be relatively clear if there are several contracts for places of use. Laura stated that 
cases where the place of use is the same in November/Christmas/January are clear, but 
more complicated are the cases where the place of use has changed in the meantime and 
at the end of January there are more sellers. In this case, more reasoning is needed for compensation 
to the selection of the seller. Tarja asked about the implementation method for several places of use, 
Laura answered that if the place of use has remained the same, this is a clear king, ie 
compensation is made by 31.1. seller of the day. Jani asked if there would be refunds 
by location? Laura stated that yes. Jani asked if there would be compensation in that case 
for one customer from many sellers? Laura stated that this is exactly the case if the customer has 
more places of use and different sellers on 31.1., then the compensation will come 
from different sellers depending on the place of use.  
Jani asked about the energy consumption, is the whole amount per month? So it would be searchable 
the entire amount to be reimbursed? Marko stated that yes, regarding the validity of the contract 
heycalculated, i.e. if the contract is not valid for the whole month, then of course the full amount will not be paid 
month's amount. Samuli asked, doesn't it only apply to places of consumption? So it isn't

possible that there would be production jobs? Laura stated that it applies 
places of consumption.  
Mia Nyman asked that if there is a change, that the refund would include January's consumption, 
how about the netted data if there is small production? Samuli stated that this should not be the case 
be relevant, because even now it can be netted for November-December, in which case the network is 
made a netting. Mia specified that from January, according to the law, there will be a data hub 
netting. Marko stated that we should come back to this later. 
Tarja returned to Pia's suggestion that the personal identification number be included in the material. 
This would make it easier in many ways, and in this case there is no need to go to the trouble of this customer 
according to the places of use vs. the terms of validity of the contracts. Has this already been considered and this is it 
completely out of the question? Marko stated that TEM has been contacted and this is now the case 
aligned in terms of data protection, personal identification information cannot be put in the file. 
Jani asked about price information. The report doesn't show these, but is there any information if they should be there 
basic fees included, these were not in the examples. Marko comments that the price information does not 
come from datahub. It was noted that the refunds include the basic fees and the energy fee. 
Pia stated that this is also how they have interpreted it. Christian comments that now that 
the total consumption amount is submitted, the legal text speaks of 24-hour-market-Finland 
the average price of the regional price, however, the articles say that the price of the second lot 
the seller who was 31.1. as a seller. The seller in question calculates 
the average price of the month from the period when I was a seller. So this will clear up then, 
if/when the project goes through. 
Mia Nyman comments on day/night divisions, whether or not 10 cents is exceeded is also needed. 
Here, it is not enough to be polite, but you have to start sharing the lesson series. Pia stated that 
when there is that ten cent price limit, i.e. those with high prices, could it be that 
the share of the night is less than 10 cents. Mia stated that they have exactly such a situation.  
Marko summed up that there were three major comments: the personal identification number situation, can it be done 
producing the material mechanically and opening the logic itself. Sari Savikoski thought mechanically 
- comment, originally the suggestion was that the seller download the report. Gladly, if 
let's go to do the mechanical possibility, could it be both? 
opportunities (both machine and report). Marko stated that we are still thinking about these, 
culminates in the workload itself, we aim to progress while ensuring the schedule.

Change 
Tarja asked about the situation of the datahub 2.1 version, the confirmation of the content and the schedule. 
I understand that the electricity subsidy issue has come in between and may affect the content of 2.1, but 
what does the content and schedule look like? Marko stated that this has been thought about a lot and next week 
it is intended to get more information about this on the portal. However, this is where the electricity support issue comes in 
influence, and the development proposals will therefore be a narrower group 
implemented as in the version. The content of the version will be confirmed in practice in May, but now 
is already a pretty good estimate of which changes/improvements can be achieved with a large one 
with probability according to the version.

Next meeting times 
Marko proposed a meeting for week 10, weeks 8-10 are all winter holiday weeks and in week 10 
least absentees. Tarja Teroheimo stated that such a time that is 
important for the whole. Marko suggested 7.3. days at 2 p.m., this suited the participants 
(excl. those on winter holidays in Northern Finland).  
On April 13, 2023, the purpose is to go through other proposals that have gone through the development work group, which 
need guidance from the sub-working group.
