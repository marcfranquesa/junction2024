Current overview of the data hub 
Customer service – Jenni Mäkinen 10 min 
 
Jenni reviewed the current issues of customer service (appendix 1 "Datahub 
Development working group AspaTerveiset11-2022"). Pia Aaltonen comments on cancellation situations 
regarding the guideline model, that concrete examples are specifically needed 
in text format, e.g. has there been a change of seller or a move. Network company cancels situations 
examples are also welcome, as this cancellation reason has sometimes been misused. Nina 
Leikas also needed examples of cancellation situations in story form, similar ones that exist 
was in the previous procedural instructions. Jenni stated that the biggest problem at the moment is 
the fact that contracts are concluded, even if they are meant to be cancelled, in which case this is also the case 
you should be able to open the situation in the instructions. 
Greetta brought up the importance of the fact that 
termination would be an event for the networks (if the functionality in question could be connected

to the mass tool). Suvi commented that there would be no need to guess whether the contract situations are different 
way in your own system vs. datahub.  
 
Development team - Marko Juslin 10 min.  
 
Marko presented the situation and schedule related to the development of customer information management (appendix 2 
"Datahub Development team current affairs 112022"), there has also been a lot related to the matter 
development proposals from the industry. It is intended to be created on the basis of data from Datahub 
data quality analyses. The purpose is to form a working group (smaller temporary 
sub-working group) to spar the preparation of the FG. Pia brought up the validation rules which 
Tita has had vs. what the datahub could have, Laura stated that they don't have the hub 
there will likely be new validations related to 2.0 customer data. Marko stated that we are trying 
to identify which validation rules (e.g. related to the format of the phone number) are appropriate 
do in any case, even if there is a bigger development in the management of customer data 
as the final result of the analyses.  
Pia brought up the instruction side / Fingrid's supervision in situations where the customer 
e-mail addresses are updated several times a day. Niina Leikas comments on the big ones 
from customers' customer information updates, which will be hundreds. Suvi also comments e.g. 
DOCUSCAN address as the customer's mailing address, which sometimes causes mail 
ending up at wrong addresses. Niina hoped that we would go through the situations as instructions that 
for example "DOCUSCAN" is not the customer's mailing address. Pia also brought up the situation, 
that all parties have the option to put the address in two places (invoicing vs. 
postal address), so it should be required that each party has the necessary places for both 
for addresses. 
 
Greetta asked if it is possible to do the development of customer data in stages, such as 
add validation rules. Marko stated that it is possible to choose individual development sites 
to be taken forward separately alongside the analysis work on the quality of the broader customer data. Summer 
asked if it is possible to perform a quality check against external registers (which would allow 
catch, e.g., wrong hetu/name combinations). Marko stated that revision is intended 
review customer information in a separate sub-working group.  
Marko went through the "End customer has a large number of contracts" problem. As a solution 
the situation is that in addition to the place of use, customer information is also locked 
for the duration of the contract notice. Pia asked if it could happen that if oneto the customer 
if 50 contracts are announced, the first one will go through and the rest will be blocked / 
to a mistake. Suvi and Pia stated that the situation sounds worrying, whether the lockdown will remain 
because of another contract, for example for a timeout. Suvi pointed out that the situation must 
describe to the industry how the lock is practically visible to the parties. Jari Arve commented, 
that if the lock lasts milliseconds, there will be no problem. If the lock takes longer, 
there will be problems. Marko had no information about the testing situation, but the testing must be done 
sufficiently comprehensively with a large set of contracts.  
Finally, Marko presented the documentation, commenting and publishing of changes to the industry 
more specifically. Greetta asked if the intention was to go through potential emerging issues in the industry 
comments also among the development team. Marko stated that these will be reviewed first 
instead only among the FG, but if the comment e.g. contradicts the development group

with the previously recommended solution, and the situation will be reviewed if necessary 
again in the development group. Greetta asked if we could communicate 
recommendation of the development working group for the developer of the development proposal. To the ticket holder 
is communicated at the stage when a new development proposal comes, that it will go 
forward to the development team, but there will be further communication afterwards 
to think separately later.

Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision – 3 h 0 min 
• 
The recommendation from the working group (will the items be moved forward in the development process), applies 
the following points of the list of development proposals, the solution proposal and justifications in Appendix 3

thing, no problem with your system provider 
▪ 
Mia Nyman: We didn't think it was necessary, no more 
▪ 
Suvi Manninen: Not a familiar problem, agree with the previous ones, no 
to continue 
▪ 
Päivi Karppanen: No more, the system administrator has to do it 
changes in their own system 
▪ 
Niina Leikas: Not a familiar thing, according to the system editor, a change 
would be good because it would enable the automation to be improved. But 
however, there is no need for this. 
▪ 
Pekka Eerikäinen: It sounds like a problem for one operator 
▪ 
Pia Aaltonen: No more 
▪ 
Jari Arve: No need, the price tag seems big, I would think of something else 
solution 
▪ 
Kirsi Jylhä: Not a familiar problem, no more 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: No development proposal 
defended 
o #8 (Fingrid), measurement data process, Minna presented the development proposal and 
solution description

solution description 
▪ 
Kari: We support the proposal 
▪ 
Greetta: The customer's advantage is that if there is a need, there is a need to get information 
for three years, and if the authorizations are in order, yes 
is supported.  
▪ 
Mia: One year is basically enough, but if others can see 
as necessary, then OK.  
▪ 
Summer: If the sellers feel it is necessary, as is 
illogicalities with the seller and the service provider are supported 
▪ 
Päivi: We support, why was there a difference of 1 vs. 3 years in the beginning?

Niina: Sellers should be treated the same as service providers, 
i.e. supported

Pekka: Improves consumption forecasts if data is available 
for a longer period of time. We support it. Why was it even limited in the first place 
in three years, why not, for example, the whole history?  
▪ 
Pia: This is a bug because different information is offered to the seller and 
to the service provider. We support it. Pia pointed out that

the repair obligation is for three years, which may be the reason for that 
to the original time. 
▪ 
Jari: If the customer's authorizations are in order, it is supported.  
▪ 
Kirsi: We support it.  
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Development proposal 
was advocated 
o #62 measurement data process, Pia started the development proposal and Minna 
solution description. 
▪ 
Jari: No identified need, sounds like good functionality, 
but the size class is guessing. If there is a wider need, we will be involved, 
otherwise I don't see the need. 
▪ 
Kirsi: I agree, it sounds like a nice feature, but is it? 
really a wider need. Information can be managed in your own 
in the system.  
▪ 
Pia: "I don't know if sellers make this kind of comparison in general, there should be a reason." 
▪ 
Pekka: Quite a useful and good addition, the sellers know best if it is 
need for this. The price tag suggests, it can also be done in house.  
▪ 
Kari: Along the same lines as the previous ones 
▪ 
Greetta: Same here, would there be a way around this?  
▪ 
Mia: Same here, nice-to-have, but not a must. 
▪ 
Suvi: Along the same lines, certainly useful, but does everyone have one 
do the sellers need to use it?  
▪ 
Päivi: I agree, if it can be done cheaply.  
▪ 
Niina: There is no need, but it would be a nice addition. However, you don't want to 
costs a lot.  
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: 
There was no wider need for the development proposal, unless it is successful

for us. 
▪ 
Pia: Ok. Is all such updating behind CGI, or can it 
FG manage these themselves? Marko stated that at the moment only 
the system provider makes these changes because it also requires 
taking care of system version control.

a comprehensive review of open monitoring events. 
▪ 
Kari: Cautious approval

recommendation for the development proposal, but also requires in the first place

▪ 
Jari: Size category high, not considered a big challenge at the moment. No 
here it is necessary to see it as necessary, but if it is necessary for others then so be it 
can be involved. Careful yes.  
▪ 
Pia: The seller's challenges elsewhere at the moment are not working for us 
added value. The price tag is also high. No further. 
▪ 
Pekka: I can't estimate the extent of the need, but if there is a need 
real so ok. Careful yes. 
▪ 
Niina: It's easier to check your own message traffic 
historical information, if it's important to others, it won't be scored against, but no 
necessary for oneself.  
▪ 
Päivi: I understand what is being asked and it could be clever, contracts 
the clearing work takes the most time and could make it easier. Daily ones 
the people doing the work can find the information elsewhere, so it's not necessary. 
Big price tag. It would also be important to know what information has been cancelled 
contracts are imported: by whom, on what date cancelled 
etc. 
▪ 
Summer: Would speed things up, e.g. by operators 
finding cancellations is challenging. If you could see the ones canceled and by whom 
canceled by, that would make it easierinvestigation work. I see 
necessary, we can manage with the current methods, but they are employable. 
Careful yes.  
▪ 
Mia: If there is enough information about the cancellations, it will speed up the processing. 
Nice to have, but expensive. Careful yes.  
▪ 
Greetta: Maybe something dependent on the customer information system, on my own 
the system shows canceled contracts. Nice that you thought about it 
more broadly, so that the balance sheet information would also be displayed. Careful yes if 
cost 1+.   
▪ 
Kari: Careful yes.  
▪ 
Kirsi: The author of the proposal.  
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Advocacy 
little more than resistance. Let's check the price estimate and 
we will return to the matter if the price clearly deviates from the initial estimate

solution description.

Kari: If the event is pointless, it will be deleted.

▪ 
Jari: A legal issue that should be able to be handled 
in every system, I see it as a bug and this should be addressed 
as a bug.  
▪ 
Pia: The topic was already discussed in the process working group, where 
told that the necessary information/functionality would be imported 
to the customer portal. If you have to do it, you have to e.g. FG's 
customer service to be able to insert the "lock the customer" button 
on, e.g. so that it would be valid for three days.  
▪ 
Pekka: Is it a theoretical or a real problem? Why the customer 
would like to limit the use of your data and not correct your data? If 
there are one case a year, it's not worth building anything amazing 
co. for the situation. 
▪ 
Niina: There have been no similar cases. That sounds good, 
that individual locking by the operator could be done. 
▪ 
Päivi: Must be able to handle possible individual situations.  
▪ 
Suvi: Isn't there a feature in the datahub that FG itself could lock 
any customer information? You could ask CGI how the customers do 
the locking is successful and so that it wouldn't cost too much either.

Kari: The reason is to map out whether adding 99 would cause problems. 
▪ 
Kirsi: Only one is allowed in our own systems, requires clarification. 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Let's find out more and 
brought up again at some point, not critical 
o #142 site process, Laura presented the development proposal and 
solution description. 
▪ 
Kari: If it's a small change, then we support it. 
▪ 
Greetta: What is the extent of the problem? Should 
customer information systems develop this relationship, the system does not 
should deliver a message if no information changes.  
▪ 
Mia: I agree. 
▪ 
Suvi: From whom of all parties does this become apparent, does it apply 
individual party?  
▪ 
Päivi: From which of all parties does this come to light? Should inform 
these parties that such useless messages come. FG should 
find out the parties who act in this way. The party is not 
maybe even noticed that they are sending useless messages.  
▪ 
Niina: The sending party must ensure that there are no unnecessary messages 
source. 
▪ 
Pekka: It's a bit unclear if someone is updating unnecessarily 
annual usage estimates, or does someone just update the information on the place of use 
incorrectly, output end problem. 
▪ 
Pia: The problem of the output end.

▪ 
Jari: The problem of the starting point. 
▪ 
Kirsi: I don't know how big the problem is, if there is a bigger problem, 
so cautious endorsement.  
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Let's find out more 
extent of the problem before moving forward.  
o #145 general management, Laura introduced the development proposal and 
solution description 
▪ 
Jari: How big was the challenge? At a reasonable cost, ok. 
▪ 
Pia: I agree.  
▪ 
Pekka: I agree, if the costs are reasonable. Clear for this 
the need, in which case the process to move the proposal forward should 
speed up.  
▪ 
Niina: I agree, if the costs are reasonable.  
▪ 
Päivi: I agree. Making repairs is different today when 
datahub is involved in the investigation. It's worth thinking about 
management of exceptional situations as a whole. All parties 
the common interest is that contracts end and begin at the same time 
day (e.g. Karhu Voima case). 
▪ 
Suvi: Does this include all situations? E.g. that events 
would go from decisions to networks. Not only support for this, 
but you have to think more broadly in terms of the industry.  
▪ 
Mia: I agree, you need to know more about pricing.  
▪ 
Greetta: We need to broaden our perspective in the direction of networks, 
development proposal made from the point of view of the now closing seller and FG. 
Sellers and networks should ask how the situation would beyou take care of it 
better.  
▪ 
Kari: All related situations must be taken into account at the same time. 
▪ 
Kirsi: I agree. It's good to take everyone's opinions into account. 
Summary of the proposal and its promotion: I still have to 
to find out, but also to quickly move on because 
the market situation may be difficult in the coming winter. 
 
o #57 contract process, also #104 contract process. In the previous one 
in the meeting we discussed the possibilities to be created at the place of use 
about new facilities, Laura introduced a new option (option 2) for this, see annex

4 "Amendment proposal #57 - Updates 2.11.2022", where for places of use and 
new reasoning rules are added to contractual situations.  
o Discussed this option together and replaced the pre-imported one 
example 3 with new examples 3a and 3b. It was jointly decided that these 
the changes cover the necessary solution. 
o Suvi asked if there is a price difference for options 1 and 2? The FG noted that the 2nd proposal 
is, according to the preliminary assessment, more affordable.

is better:

▪ 
Pia: Option 2 
▪

We went through how we want to proceed with regard to the following development proposals, which 
have been processed before and from which a more detailed cost estimate was obtained, in the appendix 
3 "Datahub change wishes 20221018" primers for the discussion:  
o #65 authorization process, Marko stated that the development proposal was under consideration 
at the last meeting and the cost/benefit of the DH-800 part remained open. 
Marko went through a more detailed cost estimate and also supplemented it 
justification for the proposal. Will DH-800 process changes be made 
also, are the changes made to the CAP enough?  
▪ 
Kirsi: How much does CAP implementation reduce manual work? (FG replied, 
that it still requires a lot of manual work, because energy reporting
types of authorizations could still be made). Kirsi can see

based on this, the DH-800-
for the process. 
▪ 
Kari: Authorization reasons and types should be what they should be, we support it.

▪ 
Päivi: I agree. 
▪
