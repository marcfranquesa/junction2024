preliminary 2.2 
2.2 version changes to functionality: 
• 
Location status update "Disabled" or "Removed from system" -
change to the space is not allowed if the place of use has a parallel place of use 
at the time of entry into force or thereafter. Also added focus 
from the moment of entry into force also to the corresponding rules concerning the energy community (already 
existing rules). (Chapters 4.7 and 4.8) Development Proposal #201 
• 
If the DH-341 process returns the effective previous/future vendor 
agreement, the DH-341-3 message conveys the reinstated agreement 
identifier (chapter 6.9.1). Development proposal #56 
o 
Update 17 October 2023: Contract ID in DH-341-3 message 
is also sent to the seller of the reinstated contract.  
• 
Added a new reason code 'Termination of the seller's activity' (AN05) for the contract 
for deciding. The seller can use the code when announcing the decision himself DH-
at the 331 event. If the operator uses the mass event for its operations 
for concluding sales contracts/future sales contracts of the finalizing seller 
for cancellation, the distribution system operator is notified of the terminations DH-331-2-
with messages and about cancellations with DH-341-2 messages. Regarding decisions 
messages (DH-331-2) use the new reason code AN05 and cancellation 
in messages concerning reason code AR02 ('The seller has canceled the contract'). 
(Chapters 6.6, 6.9.1, 6.10, 13.3.6, 13.3.10, 14) Development proposal #141

Introduction 
1.1 
General 
This document contains the interface descriptions related to the data exchange of the data hub. Document 
is based on datahub's business processes and data model. 
The documentation has been produced in close cooperation with the industry and datahub's technical department 
by a group of experts. The industry was also given the opportunity to comment on the document 
after its completion.  
Chapter 2 presents general rules related to messages and events that apply to interfaces 
generally.  
Chapters 4-12 describe the information content used in different datahub events, events 
intermediary chains and preliminary transaction validations. 
The event validations presented in the document are preliminary and the validations will be refined 
in the planning and implementation phase of the system. In addition to the checks listed 
event validation checks event-specific data requirements and enumerations, i.e 
code lists. A negative acknowledgment is returned for incorrect transactions.  
Chapter 13 describes the general message types that are used to implement the events described in Chapters 4-12. 
The XML specifications will be made according to this chapter.

General interface specifications 
ebIX® message specifications (www.ebix.org) are used as the basis for the interface specifications, 
the combined Nordic retail market (Harmonized Nordic Retail project / HNR) and Norway 
specifications and documentation of the datahub project (Elhub). 
The standards and message definitions presented above have been applied where possible. Finland 
however, the datahub's functional set is considerably wider, so the existing 
the direct utilization of the specifications as such remains limited. Finland compared to Elhub 
datahub models a centralized customer register, sales and 
online contract information, product and price information, and invoice line information. In addition, Finland's data hub 
is entirely based on hourly measurement data, while in Elhub it is also processed 
profile usage readings. Due to the reasons described above, we have had to use interfaces 
to make a significant number of national expansions. Because the number of plugins needed is 
significant, in certain situations the message structure is also simplified compared to ebIX-
to message specifications. 
The acknowledgment message that uses the ebIX structure, which is defined, is used as the acknowledgment message 
for the datahub's needs.  
2.1 
Namespace (namespace)  
The XML namespace is used to identify the elements and attributes of messages and events. Datahub-
the namespace definition is used in messages: 
urn:fi:datahub:mif:<Package>:<Message type>_<Message name>:<Major version> 
Package - The following values ​​are used: 
• 
masterdata - Messages related to structural data updates 
• 
metering - Messages related to metering data 
• 
invoicing- Messages related to invoicing 
• 
query - Messages related to queries 
• 
common - The namespace of the common elements of the messages. 
Message type defines the type of message. 
• 
E.g. F01 
Message name defines the name of the message. 
• 
E.g. MasterDataCustomerEvent

Namespaces to be used are described in more detail in Datahub's XML schema specification. 
2.2 
Versioning 
2.2.1 
Newspaper version 
The message version is represented in the namespace definitions of the xml file. There will be a news version 
to update in a situation where changes are made to messages that do not backfire anymore 
compatibility with the previous message version. Such changes include, for example: 
• 
Deleting or changing enumeration values 
• 
Changes to the names of elements, types, or attributes 
• 
Changes to the structure or order of the message 
• 
Removing or adding required elements or attributes 
• 
Making elements or attributes mandatory 
2.2.2 
A subversion of Sanoma 
Message definitions can be updated with a subversion without a version update when the messages 
backward compatibility is maintained. These changes are represented in the XML schema definition 
with the xsd:version attribute in the schema file (.xsd). 
• 
Adding enumeration values 
• 
Optional message extensions  
2.3 
Message structure 
All datahub messages consist of the following parts: 
• 
Message header information 
• 
Process information 
•

Note: 
Focusing 
[1] 
In Datahub's message traffic, all received messages are created 
acknowledgment message. The acknowledgment request is not presented in the message header. 
[2] 
The message identifier must always be unique for each sender. Datahub rejects the message if 
a message with the same message ID has already been received from the same sender and it is 
asynchronous event (see chapter 2.12 of this document and Datahub External Interface 
Specification). The retransmission is always done with a new message ID and to corrected ones 
for information and also in a situation where the same information is sent again. 
[3] 
The technical operator of the message means the party that delivers/receives the message. 
The legal operator of the message refers to the party whose information is processed in the message. 
For example, if the service provider takes care of the measurement data collection and delivery to the data hub 
(on behalf of the distribution system operator), the technical sender is the service provider and the legal sender is 
distribution system operator. The technical operator must always have the authorization of the legal operator in question 
to the process. 
[4] 
The sender of the message can set the routing information in the message, which is returned in the acknowledgment message. 
The routing information can be used in the routing of the received acknowledgment to the original one 
to the system that sent the message. 
[5] 
In Datahub's processes, DH-22* responses can contain such a large amount of information that it 
it makes sense to split into several different messages so that the size of one message does not grow huge. 
In this case, the fields Message number and Total messages are filled with numbers that indicate 
how many different messages the information content is divided into and which message from the series is in question.

In XML schema validation, the message is checked against the schema on a technical level. Validation 
checks the mandatory and data format of the message structure, elements and attributes 
correctness (format and maximum field length) and data enumerations. In the event of an error 
a SOAP level rejection (SOAP Fault) is returned. 
2.5.2 
Process validations 
In process validation, the process level information, the process ID and role, and the party are checked 
rights to report that process event. Datahub checks the sender of the message 
user rights on two different levels: the notifier's right to initiate said market event (eg 
DH-131) and the notifier's right to market information related to the message (such as a specific place of use).  
The right to the processed market data is always checked solely on the basis of the legal sender. 
The right to perform a certain market transaction is also based on the user rights of the legal sender 
(the right is determined through the market role). However, the legal sender can give to another person 
the party the right to notify a certain event on its own behalf. In this case, you must go to the data hub 
defined as the so-called assignment, which is described in chapter 2.16. 
The allowed roles of message senders are listed in the paragraph Sanomalist. In the event of an error 
a SOAP fault (SOAP Fault) is returned.

2.5.3 
Event validations 
Transaction validation includes transaction-specific validations in accordance with the market process, which do not 
Validate in XML schema and process validations. Validation is performed in event validation 
fulfillment of dependencies and time limits between the attributes of the notification. In addition, declared values 
is validated against the data content of the data hub. The validations for the passed transaction are returned 
positive acknowledgment message. Incorrect messages will be returned with a negative acknowledgement 
error message (error code and error text). 
In connection with event validation, the values ​​of the declared attributes are also validated according to the data standard 
against the rules defined in the "allowed values" column. A Finnish personal identification number will be required 
for example, fulfills the requirements set for it by legislation 
(http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2010/20100128). 
The event-specific descriptions (chapters 4-12) list those related to the event in question 
event validations. 
2.6 
Receipt processing 
Datahub acknowledges the parties' requests on two different levels: on the technical level and on the process level. 
On a technical level, the datahub interface always responds to each party's request, indicating whether 
request understoodretted and received in full or not. This is the so-called interface technical 
acknowledgment, which is separate from, for example, the business so-called presented in sequence diagrams 
process level acknowledgements. These technical acknowledgments are not modeled in sequence diagrams.  
Datahub always delivers either a positive or negative acknowledgment to received messages 
also at the process level. The information returned in survey events serves as a positive acknowledgment 
and a negative acknowledgment message is returned from the error situation. In negative acknowledgment 
the errors manifested in the process and event validation described in chapter 2.5 are reported. 
For synchronous services, process-level acknowledgment is returned to the party after 
datahub has fully processed the service request. For asynchronous services 
datahub first returns a technical acknowledgment of the approval of the request and later 
of processing the asynchronous process-level acknowledgment event itself. Asynchronous services and 
their acknowledgment processes are described in more detail in chapter 2.12. Always used in the Datahub interface 
acknowledgment message in such a way that the header information of the message does not specify separately whether acknowledgment is desired 
or not. 
When retrieving messages from the data hub, the receiving party must acknowledge receipt of the messages 
as described in chapter 2.11. 
In the Datahub interface, process-level acknowledgments comply with the ebIX structure 
an acknowledgment message containing a header, process and acknowledgment event. Sanoma's process section 
has the same content as in the original message to be acknowledged. The content of the acknowledgment event is 
next.

[1] 
The partially accepted acknowledgment type is used in datahub's measurement data messages 
when receiving measurement data. In this case, the rejected time series are reported at the Time series level 
in the receipt. When retrieving measurement data from the data hub, this acknowledgment type is not used 
[2] 
Also used in a positive acknowledgment to indicate the type of update in the datahub. 
E.g. In the confirmation of a new sales contract, what is concluded by datahub is returned 
reason for starting the sales contract (change of contract, change of seller, move-in) 
In the "Details of transaction level acknowledgment" field. 
[3] 
If the acknowledgment type is "Partially rejected", the series will be indicated in the series information 
abandoned. Each rejected series can have several different types of acknowledgments, which 
will be reported under the Serial Level Acknowledgment. 
 
The technical description of the acknowledgment message is presented in chapter 13.4.

News lists 
The table below shows a summary of the events in the market processes and in them 
words to be used. The message column in the table refers to common message types. General 
the message type can be used in one or more market processes. In chapter 12 
describes the data content of these message types, the format of the data fields, example data, the XML data
reference and the levels and obligations of the data fields in terms of the XML message and the schema. 
Process-specific data contents, levels and obligations of data fields and process-specific 
comments are presented in chapters 3-12. 
In time series type messages, ebiX messages applied based on NBS specifications are used 
(E66 for measurement data andE31 for balance sheet information). Sufficient equivalence for other events 
In the ebiX specifications, only a place for structural information was found (E58). For other messages 
has ended up defining the national data hub messages (Fxx messages) separately.

2.10 
Mediation of events 
Datahub forwards the received events to the necessary parties. Forwarded by default 
the same information as in the received message. If the information content differs, it is mentioned separately. 
For contract events (contract creation and update events), separate ones have been defined 
transmission transactions, because not all contractual information should be transmitted between the parties. 
If the update event notified to datahub based on the update request does not already contain changes 
compared to the information in the datahub, the information is forwarded only to the party that is 
requested information update. Such request events include a request to update customer information 
from the distribution system operator to the seller and a request to update the usage location information from the seller to the distribution system operator. 
2.11 
Event pickup 
Datahub does not deliver messages to the parties automatically, instead the messages are buffered 
to the transmission queue, from which the party retrieves the messages one at a time. Datahub delivers the messages 
in the order according to the creation time shown in the message header information. The retrieved message remains 
still available for pickup by the party until the party has separately notified datahub 
having received the message. The parties retrieve the messages using a retrieval event.  
The information content of the pick-up event is as follows:

Note:

In addition to the event data, the information related to the respective message package is also returned 
acknowledgment events. 
 
Asynchronous searches, i.e. searches for measurement data and calculation line data, are differentiated on each side 
into their own separate queues. In this case, asynchronous searches do not mix with other information exchange. 
The measurement data is broken down for each party separately by datahub in transaction DH-211 
and to the queues of measurement data requested by the party with DH-220 transactions. The parties can decide themselves 
how the queues will be unloaded into the party's own systems when implementing the interface. 
2.12 
Synchronicity/asynchrony of events 
In terms of structural data update and query events, the service interfaces are synchronous. 
Acknowledgment and/or response information to the survey is returned as a response to the service request of the same session 
during. 
In terms of time series data (measurement data and balance sheet information) and invoice line data, the services are 
asynchronous for both notification events and search events. Datahub restores 
immediately a synchronous technical level acknowledgment that the party's request/notification is 
accepted for processing. Acknowledgments of the actual transaction processing and response information to the survey 
returned separately via the pick-up service asynchronously. 
2.12.1 Asynchronous searches 
When a search event arrives, the interface checks that the search is in the form of specifications 
adequate. At the same time, a check is made that the party has the right to send based on its role 
that kind of search event. If the form check or role check produces a negative result, 
datahub returns a negative acknowledgment and the processing of the search ends. 
If the application transaction is in the correct format, and the party has the necessary role for the transaction, 
datahub starts processing the search. In this context, we check whether the party has the right 
to the requested information at the point of use level. If the party has applied for a wider set of data, from which 
he is only entitled to a part, datahub returns the part of the requested data to which the party is a party 
is right. An error message will be returned for the information to which the applicant is not entitled.

Encryption and compression of message traffic 
Transactions are transferred encrypted HTTPS (TLS 1.2). Messages are signed using certificates 
WS-Security. Messages are not separately encrypted using WS-Security. 
The measurement data events to be sent must be compressed, and the measurement data transmitted by the data hub must be compressed accordingly 
the events are packed. Compression is done during data transfer (HTTP/S) using HTTP 
Compression technology. 
2.14 
The ID and sender of the original message 
Several datahub transactions have the information field "Identifier of the original message". This field 
is used to link related events into a chain of events. The field is not used in the chain 
in the first events, but in the other events of the event chain this field is always 
the message ID of the previous event. 
Example:  
1. The seller announces the new contract with transaction DH-311-1. Not used in this event 
"Identifier of the original message" field, because it starts the chain 
2. Datahub transmits information about the new contract to the distribution system operator with transaction DH-311-
2. In this transaction, the field contains the message ID of the previous DH-311-1 transaction.

3. The distribution network operator confirms the network contract with transaction DH-312-1. Since the event 
is a response to the DH-311 event initiated by the seller, "Identifier of the original message" 
the field contains the message ID of the previous DH-311-2 event. 
4. Datahub transmits information about the confirmation of the online contract to the seller with transaction DH-312-2. 
In this transaction, the field contains the message ID of the previous DH-312-1 transaction. 
The sender data field of the original message is used accordingly. In the example described above 
in transaction DH-311-2, the field would indicate that the original DH-311-1 transaction was sent 
seller ID. In event DH-312-1, the sender of event DH-311-2 is indicated in the field (i.e 
data hub). In transaction DH-312-2, the field states that transaction DH-312-1 has been sent 
ID of the distribution system operator. 
2.15 
Structural data updates 
In Datahub, structural data updates are processed in two alternative ways: 
as a full update or a partial update.  
Size update is used for all structural data updates other than 
in updating customer information. For example, updating the usage location information updates all the reported ones 
information. When the distribution system operator updates the data of the point of use, the previously valid data of the point of use 
the information will cease to be valid and will be replaced by new information provided. If so 
for example, previously there were 6 addresses in the place of use, but in the update there are only 4 in the place of use 
address, in the future only the 4 addresses indicated in the update will be valid in the datahub at the place of use. 
In a partial update, only the information indicated in the event is updated. Partial update is used 
of actual update events only when updating customer data. If customer data 
in the update, in addition to the mandatory information, only the customer's e-mail address is indicated, 
only the email address is updated in the customer's information. If the customer has already had 
phone number, it will not be deleted. If you want to delete some information from the data hub in the partial update, 
the data field in question is included in the event but empty. Data fields that partial update 
are not involved in the event retain their former value.  
Also in update request events (such as distribution system operator or 3rd party customer data 
update request, request to update user location information of the seller or a 3rd party) is used the same 
principle than in partial updates. Based on the request, the party making the actual update 
should interpret the received update request as a partial update. 
2.16 
Assignments 
The seller or the distribution system operator can commission another party (the seller, the distribution system operator or 
of a 3rd party) to announce datahub events or to pick up datahub's forwarded/announced events 
messages in turn. The assignment of notification messages means the assignment of a process (for example 
DH-311-1 Notice of new sales contract) initiated by the other party 
commissioned. The assignment of relay messages means that normally

the message received by the principal is forwarded to the assignee instead of the principal 
(for example DH-111-2 Transmission of customer data to the distribution system operator). 
In assignments, the authorization to use the market data to be processed is carried out by the assignee 
according to the party's rights. More precisely, with regard to market data, the right of use check 
is performed in datahub according to the legal sender indicated in the market message (see 2.16.1). 
The assignment of notification and forwarding messages can be applied separately to different parties 
regardless of the market event. In other words, the notification message of the same market event and 
proxy messages can be assigned to different parties (if in the said process the notifying party also 
receive relay messages). 
Each market transaction/broker message order between two parties 
is assigned to the datahub separately via the datahub user interface. This can only be done 
datahub operator. The operator adds orders from the ordering party's service request, 
which should be done through the support portal. Configurations are made in the datahub individually at the message level and 
the parties can search and view (but not update) assignments in the datahub user interface 
through. 
The assignments apply to both synchronous and asynchronous messages. 
2.16.1 Notification of the event by assignment 
The assignment of the market process entitles the contracting party to send B2B messages 
datahub on behalf of the commissioning party. This can be provided by the contracting party 
the right to several different contractors per market event.  
In a notification based on an assignment, the contracting party sends a message to datahub. 
In this case, the physical sender field of the message must contain the ID of the party who commissioned the order, and 
the legal sender field must contain the ID of the ordering party. The process role comes 
determine the message according to the legal party (for example, in DH-311 transactions 
the process role is "DDQ" i.e. Seller and not "THP" i.e. 3rd party). 
In the measurement data notification (DH-211) event, the commissioning party can also notify 
that they want a copy (CC) of the forwarding message. In this case, a proxy message is also formed 
to the ordering party's message queue. 
2.16.2 Assignment of a proxy message 
The forwarding message assignment defines which forwarding messages are sent to the contractor 
instead of the ordering party. 
In mandated forwarding messages, the physical recipient field has the assignee 
the party's ID, and the legal recipient field contains the assigning party's ID. So 
in age forwarding messages, the process role corresponds to the legal one according to the transaction definition 
the role of the receiver.

In contrast to orders for the execution of market transactions, each assigned 
per proxy message, there can only be one party responsible for the successful delivery of the data 
for verification. The assignment of relay messages can only be performed for events that 
include transmission of relay messages. In other words, Synchronous response messages are always sent 
to the physical sender of the message.  
The copy (CC) option for mandated relay messages is not currently defined 
to any of the current market events and it is thus not possible for the time being. 
In assignments of relay messages, all messages related to the same process (can be several 
notifications) are assigned to one (and therefore the same) organization. 
2.16.3 General rules for assignments 
The following principles apply to the commissioning of processes (market events): 
• 
Announcements or proxy messages where the market/process role is "3rd party" are not allowed 
commission. 
• 
In searches for measurement, balance sheet, product, and invoice line data, a query message can be used 
commissions and the requested information is always returned to the physical person who initiated the transaction 
to the sender. 
2.16.4 Assignment information 
The following information must be defined in Datahub for each individual assignment: 
• 
Assignment start date 
• 
Commissioning party 
• 
Contracting party 
• 
Direction (event notification/reception of forwarding message) 
• 
Event/message to be assigned 
• 
Copy to the ordering party 
o Only possible in the DH-211 event 
• 
Assignment description (optional) 
The information listed above must be entered in the service request. Instructions can be found on the Datahub Palvelut portal.

Descriptions of Datahub events 
The following chapters describe datahub events, their rules and data contents. In this chapter 
The operation of datahub events is described in general, and future chapters are presented 
the structure of event descriptions. 
Datahub will be built on the basis of various events (services). The event is 
a single interaction between the parties and datahub, usually a request, notification or information 
an update event consisting of the steps shown in the image below. 
 
FIGURE 111 DESCRIPTION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DATAHUB EVENT 
1. The party initiates the transaction by making a change to its own system, from which 
a transaction request is sent to the datahub interface. The request must contain the necessary information 
to complete the transaction. Datahub can also initiate the event. 
2. Datahub validates the format, data content and 
event-specific other rules. If validation fails, the transaction is aborted and 
the flow of the event moves to step 5. The levels of validation are described in more detail 
in the next chapter. 
3. If necessary, datahub processes data according to the definition of the event (for example 
different calculations). 
4. Data that is validated and generated or updated during possible processing is saved 
to the datahub database.

5. The party initiating the transaction will be acknowledged the success of the transaction or 
failure. After the rejecting acknowledgment, the party must correct the error and send 
request again. 
6. After successful execution, information is forwarded to a possible other party 
according to the specifications. The other party may send a new request 
based on the information it receives, resulting from the original event 
a chain of several events, i.e. a process. 
According to the description above, the following table is prepared for each event, which describes 
execution of the event.

The events described above can successively form more complex processes, 
such as seller–change or moving processes. Most of the events will start 
automatically when the party updates the information in its own system. Each party 
the responsibility is to put the information in the format required by datahub. 
After the table describing the execution of the event, a sequence diagram for the event is presented 
the related information exchange between the parties and the contents of the events as a class diagram. Class diagram 
a description of the message content of the event follows the tablein full size. The purpose of class diagrams is 
only represent what information is announced or conveyed in the event, it is not their purpose 
in its structure, it perfectly corresponds to the message description of the document. The messages will be implemented 
According to the Datahub events document.  
3.1 
Event cancellation and error correction 
Incorrectly reported data must be able to be corrected in datahub. The most important thing is that you don't stay in the data hub 
incorrect information for any period. Data correction is done in a different way, depending on what needs to be corrected 
about the event. 
A separate cancellation notification is used for the creation of a place of use, the seller's disconnection or connection request 
as well as in cancellations of the start or termination of the contract. In all measurement, use place, 
in updates of customer, product and invoice line information, as well as disconnections of the distribution network operator 
Incorrect information reported in connection notifications is corrected with new update events and not separately 
cancel. The corrected data must then be reported within the time limits of the market processes 
allowing at the same effective time that the incorrect information was originally sent, lest 
incorrect information remains in datahub. If there is no corrective update due to business rules 
possible to do at the same time of entry into force as the incorrect update, the correctors will be notified 
information on the effective date as early as the processes allow. 
In the case of cancellations, problems arise in situations where, based on incorrect information, there has already been time 
start other events. The main rule is that transactions at the place of use can only be canceled if 
There have been no other updates for the location in question since the original announcement 
by the parties. More detailed cancellation rules are described in the event descriptions.  
3.2 
Explanations of process maps 
In the process maps attached to the event descriptions, each event is summarized 
the process part contains. On the map, the events are not in their execution order, but that 
is described in chapter 3 of the document "Business processes of the electricity retail market".

Processing 
If the client becomes secret, all client authorizations are terminated. 
When updating customer information, a partial update is used, where only the information entered in the transaction is updated. 
Data fields that are not included in the transaction retain their previous value. If desired in partial update 
deletes some data from the data hub, that data field will be included in the transaction as empty. 
For example, if in the update of the customer information, in addition to the mandatory information, only the customer is reported 
e-mail address, the e-mail address is updated from the customer's voluntary information. If the customer already has 
a previously saved phone number, for example, remains unchanged.   
Data storage 
Reported information 
The customer information provided by the seller takes effect on the announced effective date. 
Old data is stored in the data hub. The seller is primarily responsible for customer data 
of correctness. 
Processed data 
Any updated authorization information. 
Data return/forwarding 
Data recovery 
Notification of successful or rejected update of customer information 
Transmission of information 
Alreadys update includes changes to customer information, customer information is forwarded to sellers and 
for distribution system operators who have a valid license at the time of entry into force or a maximum of 6 
expired a week earlier (only in the case of the seller) or will take effect in the future 
the future contract with the customer and for 3rd parties who have a valid 
authorization from the customer. 
If the event is a response to the distribution system operator's update request (DH-112), the information 
are forwarded to the distribution system operator who requested the update, even if they do not contain 
changes. 
If the customer is encrypted, the information contained in the update is never forwarded to 3rd parties. 
If the customer becomes secret, the notification of the change in authorization is forwarded to them 
to the parties whose authorizations were decided. 
Errors and cancellations 
Significant errors and 
consequences 
Incorrect customer information is forwarded to all parties who are entitled 
to customer information. 
Maintaining the correctness of the data is the responsibility of the personal data registrar. 
Passing on incorrect personal data is a violation of data protection. 
The customer's postal address is given incorrectly → Possible mails (incl. invoices) go 
to the wrong address, especially if the contract does not specify a separate one 
billing address. The result may be wrong collection actions or a data breach. 
The customer's contact information is reported incorrectly or incomplete → The customer cannot be reached 
contact, as the existing contact information will be deleted 
The customer's name information is reported incorrectly → Any mail (incl. invoices) will not go through

Active and reactive measurements can be applied for in the specified unit. If no unit is given 
in the search, respectively active or reactive power is not returned. At least one of the units is 
provided that data can be recovered. 
[3] 
If the search is made for individual measuring points, recommended measuring points 
the maximum amount in one search is 1000.  
[4] 
If the 'Information used in billing' element is used in the search, it must be in the search 
including the 'Measurement point type' element with the value 'F01' (place of use).  
 
If the measurement is retrieved with a higher resolution than the datahub's recording resolution, the value 
status is set to the weakest status within the time step.  
The following transaction validations are performed for the query.  
#

The survey period is neither in the future nor more than 6 years back in the past. 
3 
The unit of inquiry is the energy unit. 
 
The response event contains the same information as DH-211 (Measurement information). Measurement data is only provided 
for the period for which the party has rights to the data. The parties' rights to information aredescribed 
in the document "Business processes of the electricity retail market in the data hub" in chapter 2.2. 
In the response event, all measurements recorded at the point of use (including parasitic measurements, 
if they have been delivered to the data hub). If measurement data is requested as sum data and the output values ​​have 
one or more (not all) values ​​with the status missing are assigned to the sum value as status 
"partially missing". The "partially missing" status is only used in the above-mentioned situations. 
The measurement data response event is returned asynchronously. When searching for large 
measurement data amounts, the creation of a response event can be done in the data hub if necessary

Event description 
Definition 
The seller announces a new sales contract concluded by the customer

network contract information and the Distribution System Operator receives information about the new one 
of the contract.

The customer concludes a new contract with the seller for the customer's current or 
to a new place of use. 
Information to be reported 
Location ID, customer information and contract information, including contract-specific information 
billing addresses and contact information. 
Validation 
Rights to information 
- 
Code 
If the customer has contracts stored in the data hub for the place of use, 
the notification will not be accepted, i.e. a new contract cannot be concluded, if: 
• 
The place of use has a fixed-term valid sales contract, and 
the contract has the same customer as the new contract 
in the announcement (the start date must be later than 
the expiry date of the previous contract, if 
such exists). However, if the contract's customers are 
consumers and the term period has continued for more than 2 years, the contract 
the term does not prevent a new contract. 
• 
There is an exception in the valid contract of the place of use 
termination clause, and there is even one customer in the contract that is the same as the new one 
in the notice of the contract, and a different termination condition 
the dates do not allow a new contract to be concluded for the place of use. 
• 
The above rules are deviated from if the current seller needs to do so 
changes to the customers of the contract to the place of use, however, in such a way that 
the new contract has at least one customer who is the same as 
in the valid contract of the place of use. 
Before the new sales contract previously notified to the place of use 
entry into force, a new sales contract can be announced "in between", but in this case 
the end date of the contract must be stated and it cannot be later 
than the start date of the previously announced contract (in the document "Sähkön 
retail market business processes" in chapter 3.2.2.4 example 3). 
Only the seller responsible for delivery assigned to the measurement area of ​​the place of use can 
announces the electricity supply contract. 
The place of use can be found in datahub and is valid on the start date of the contract. 
The place of use belongs to the measurement area and is not in the state disabled or 
removed from the system on the contract start date. If the place of use already exists

disabled, the new (retroactive) contract must expire 
on or before the date of decommissioning. 
If both business customers and consumer customers are notified in the contract, 
consumer rules apply to the contract. 
The consumer customer must be at least 18 years old. 
The seller's balance sheet manager has announced the necessary seller and balance sheet manager 
relationship between (RBR) to eSett before announcing the contract. Seller-
balance sheet structure for the vendor-measuring area-consumption/production combination is 
valid on the date of commencement of the sales contract. 
If the place of use has already been notified of the termination of the sales contract with a reason 
removal of the meter, the new (retroactive) contract must end with the meter 
on or before the removal date. 
If the place of use has already been notified as corresponding to the new sales contract 
termination of the online contract, the new contract must expire accordingly 
on or before the end date of the online contract.  
If the notice of the new sales contract also states the contract 
end date, the end date can be a maximum of 90 days ahead 
from the moment of notification.  
Interrupting 
proceedings 
For the same place of use for the same contract start date earlier 
notified sales contract. Two new contracts cannot be announced as startingfor the same day, but those reported later will be rejected. As an exception 
move-in (all customers change), which also cancels earlier 
of the sales contract announced for the same starting date for the place of use, which 
the reason for the start is a change of vendor/contract (if previously announced 
the agreement is a move-in, it prevents the notification of another move-in to the same one 
for the start date). 
Time limits 
If the reason for starting the contract is moving in or changing the contract, a new one 
the sales contract can be announced for the current day at the earliest. If that's the case 
there is a change of seller, the new sales contract can be announced on the 14th at the earliest 
to start after one day, unless there is already a previous sales contract 
ended, in which case the new sales contract can start no earlier than the previous one 
ending. The notification can be sent no earlier than 90 days before 
the start date of the sales contract to be notified. 
In error correction situations, it is possible to announce a new sales contract 
to start retroactively. It is possible to declare retroactive move-in 
a maximum of 3.5 years retroactively. A retroactive change of seller is possible 
report no more than 10 years back. No retroactive change of contract 
allow in datahub. 
Processing 
Creating a customer 
If the customer of the contract to be notified is not found in datahub, it will be created 
to datahub.

reason

retail market business processes" according to table 8 of chapter 3.2.2. 
Current contract 
deciding

for the day before the start date of the new contract of the sales contract.

• 
"Termination of the contract", if the reason for starting a new contract is 
"Seller change" or "Contract change". 
Contracts 
cancellation 
Changing customers at the point of use automatically cancels everything 
start on the same or a later date than the current one of the place of use 
the customer's new sales contracts (in the document "Sähkön 
retail market business processes" in chapter 3.2.2.4 example 4). 
Confirmed or 
Unconfirmed network contracts will be cancelled. 
Network contract 
creation 
If a new network contract is needed, datahub creates a new network contract 
information (start date same as sales contract, network contract 
to "unconfirmed"). When creating a new online contract 
datahub terminates the valid network contract for the previous day. 
Rules for reasoning: 
• 
The responsibility of the contracts does not change (the new contract is the same or 
to be answered by the same customers as valid at the time of notification 
existing), in which case it is a pure change of seller or a new contract 
with the current seller → no new online contract is needed. 
• 
The responsibility of contracts changes (one or more contracting parties 
changes, is added or removed) → a new network contract is needed in order to 
the same customers are responsible for the contracts. 
• 
At the time of announcement, the online contract is already a new contract 
in the name of the customer, but the customer of the sales contract changes → new 
no online contract required. 
• 
The sales contract valid at the time of notification is 
the electricity supply contract and the new sales contract are not, or vice versa 
(if there is no sales contract in force at the time of notification, but 
a valid online contract is found, the same check is made for a new one 
sales contract and valid online contract 
Between the 'Electricity supply agreement' field) → a new one is needed 
online contract. 
• 
The customers of the new sales contract to be announced are the same as 
customers with a valid network contract, but 
the online contract has the expiry date of the new sales contract 
during the duration → a new network contract is required. Datahub decides 
the previous network agreement and sends a new network agreement 
to be confirmed. 
• 
The customers of the new sales contract to be announced are the same as 
customers of a valid network contract, but a network contract 
pending cancellation of the sales contract announced by the seller 
based on cancellation → a new online contract is required.  
Authorizations 
deciding 
If the place of use has authorizations that are valid for the new contract 
at the commencement or enter into force after the commencement of the new contract, they 
be terminated at the time the contract starts or canceled, if authorized 
the customer is also not a customer in the new sales contract. Authorizations 
is canceled if the authorization is not yet valid by setting the authorization 
end date to be the same asstart date. 
If the customer is notified confidentially with a new contract, all of that 
the customer's authorizations at any place of use, the contract is concluded

The response event contains the same information as DH-513-2/3, 514-1/2/3, 516-2. Imbalance settlement information 
is only delivered for the time period for which the party has rights to the information. The parties' rights to the information 
are described in the document "Electricity Retail Market Business Processes in Datahub" 
in chapter 2.2. 
The response event for imbalance settlement information is returned asynchronously. When retrieving large amounts of 
balance settlement information, the generation of the response event can be delayed in Datahub if necessary, if the system resource situation so requires.
