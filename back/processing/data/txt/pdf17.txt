Samuli went through the original development proposal and Laura reviewed the proposed solution
the one that would solve the underlying problem that the location of use parallel information 
can be controlled by DH-126 and DH-127 processes only for the future. 
 
In the sub-working group, there was a discussion about the necessity of change and where the problems came from 
and the need to correct the location data, and whether the problem could be solved better
with soft instructions. The group concluded that the background is often human errors, of which 
won't go away as long as people use the systems. Repair needs related to pre-
as a sign for situations where no power data has been reported for the production site, 
which is why the pair of places of use is not netted. Current rules for use of location data 
in the update and parallelism data maintenance processes mean that the netting
I don't start until the day after the repair at the earliest, and the previous episode remains ne-
not true. The problems have an impact on the customer's invoicing, and at worst they are financial 
the effects can be great. In order to get to the right situation, the changes process
hin was seen as necessary. 
 
With regard to the new operator process presented for restoring the places of use, there was some thought 
also the amount of repair needs and the possibility to handle these through the system supplier 
more cost-effective. At the moment, however, even the system supplier does not have a pro-
session to make corrections, and making corrections directly to the base must be avoided, 
which is why a new process is necessary. There is no exact information on the amount of repair needs
toa, but there have been needs and these have also caused problems on the sellers' side, 
when the distribution system operators have not received corrected information and delivered, for example, the necessary
accurate measurement data. It was generally stated that although currently the amounts of repair needs 
are still small in mass, it is important in the solution to look to the future when the masses 
are growing all the time, and with it the need to be able to correct errors will also grow-
terrestrial. Marko also stated that the preliminary cost estimate for the now presented entity is 2 
or small 3, i.e. approx. 30,000 euros. 
 
During the review of the solution description, the following observations and clarifications were made: 
• 
In connection with parallelism data corrections, Datahub never sends measurement
information to the parties. The shipment only applies to the recalculation in connection with the repair
tuja series (netting and energy community).  
• 
Active from the operator's place of usethere is no way to say about the error return-
mia to the parties, as the return is based on the request of the distribution system operator and the distribution ver-
the conholder receives the information through that. There is no longer any on the decommissioned site of use 
the seller, but the seller could have been at the place of use at the moment that the retrospective road-
correction applies. The group thought about whether the seller would be confused, 
if there are updates to a place of use that would have been disabled in the seller's information. 
However, we did not see a problem here that should be taken into account in the solution. 
• 
In terms of time limits, it was concluded that immediately after the change, retroactive cor-
access to parallelism data is allowed from 1 January 2023 and after that for 90 years
rokauta is a good default time for retroactive repairs based on the billing cycle. 
If necessary, the operator can also allow repairs further into the past.
i do Repairs can therefore be made between 90 days in the past - 90 
day in the future, i.e. also for the current day. 
• 
The current inference rules based on power information about when to take the usage places 
to the netting calculation, do not change, but the change only applies to time limits for information
for repair.

Samuli also highlighted a new proposal for the development of support reporting around the topic
ri, so that error situations could be detected faster and the planned 90 days would be enough
to repair it. It was agreed that Samuli would record a preliminary proposal for the content of the report 
for the new development proposal label. 
 
The discussion also brought up the need to return to the previously rejected development proposal 
#176, according to which Datahub would notify the distribution system operator of what is to be installed at the point of use 
netting information (whether the place of use is in netting or not). With #276 comes the netting information 
change also retroactively, and notification to the network would remove the risk of an error
desta, when the reasoning did not have to take place in the network system, but the network would receive the information 
From the data set by Datahub. It was stated that if #176 ends up being implemented, it 
should coincide with the implementation of #276. It was decided to reconsider the matter
to be discussed at the next meeting of the sub-working group.  
 
The group also presented the idea of ​​videotaping the meetings in order to get the discussion that took place 
up more easily. Marko stated that the matter can be thought about if the current model does not
drift net. 
 
Summary: Development proposal #276 received the support of the sub-working group with the solution condition described
taking into account the refinements listed in the The time limit for retroactive repairs was determined to be 90 
days into the past after the older situations have been corrected first 
change to production after export. It was agreed that #176 be brought up again 
to the January sub-working group.  
 
 
#16 – Notification of the contract coming into force upon cancellation – appendix 2 
 
Laura reviewed the question that arose in connection with the previously recommended development proposal 
on whether the new message planned for the distribution system operator is still seen as necessary, 
although the related reasoning will probably have to be carried out by the parties'
because of development proposal #69, which is already in version 2.2.  
 
The group initially discussed the need for retroactive cancellations in the first place 
due to The original background of the development proposal was not familiar to everyone, and the proposals 
in connection with this, it was hoped that when recording them, they would also remember to mention the basis of the proposals
lut and background information. The group concluded that retroactive cancellations are often related to customer
to dispute contracts or cancel vendor exchanges. It also causes cancellations 
also, for example, contracts incorrectly declared for the wrong place of use. The group pondered 
also the amounts of retroactive cancellations, but it was stated that these could not be directly accessed
wool more precise numbers.  
 
The group concluded that the planned message is still seen as necessary, even though
a Chinese implementation has to be built into the systems even before receiving it. Central-
in telu, it was also brought up that the contract situation after the cancellation is currently 
from the Datahub user interface, but the group concluded that this cannot be considered 
as a real alternative to checking the matter. Sanoma was seen to bring more

possiblesolutions made for automation and improvement version 2.2. Li-
therefore, it was seen as good that similar messages are received both by sellers and distribution network management
for tijas.  
 
Summary: A message to the distribution system operator was still considered necessary, and it should not
in a different version with development proposal #69 cause problems.

Pia posed a question to the system suppliers regarding possible future repairs

there would be repairs coming.
