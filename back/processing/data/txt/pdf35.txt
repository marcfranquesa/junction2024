The development proposals under consideration were reviewed in the working group according to the agenda in Appendix 1 
Based on "Datahub change wishes 20230330". 
o Proposal #57 site of use process 
▪ 
more information in appendix 2 "Amendment proposal 57 - options 1 and 2" 
Marko initiated amendment proposal #57 with alternatives to pre-given materials 
based on this, let's take a look at the comments of the group on the open questions in the material 
from members through.  
Option 1 
Laura was the first to present different scenarios regarding option 1 from the materials 
and open questions. The first question was whether the "subscription is under maintenance" 
still necessary space for the parties? 
Pia Aaltonen commented that this is still important information for customer service, 
the customer should be instructed in a different way depending on the customer service situation 
of the state of the place of use. Greetta Arha also stated that connection with maintenance would be important 
supplement, on the same basis as Pia. Connections are very often in maintenance mode and 
there are a lot of these in number - it would be good if these could be differentiated 
from other premises. Jani Pasanen commented that if the premises start to be moved, yes 
all necessary spaces are added at the same time. Sari Savikoski and Mia Nyman were the same 
mind.  
Other: 
o Kirsi Jylhä: I agree, all proposed facilities for use. 
o Pekka Eerikäinen: I agree. 
o Tarja Teroheimo: Are we voting on the alternatives or not 
maintenance,  
Marko clarified that here only this "subscription with maintenance" section is encountered 
will be voted on. 
o Suvi Manninen: I agree, if we end up with 1 option, we will bring it 
at the same time other facilities. 
o Tarja Teroheimo: I am questioning option 1, but if not 
there is still a vote on it, so if we are going to add more premises, we will add more 
everything possibly necessary at once. 
o Christian Rautjärvi: Let's inject everything at once if we decide to increase the facilities. 
o Pasi Kangasniemi: I agree. 
o Sami Pelkonen: I agree.

o Samuli: As a service provider of measurement data with the number of premises 
doesn't really matter, but I would point out that negative acknowledgments, 
which come in the sent measurement data, the acknowledgments should be 
more unambiguous, and not so generic. Not exactly jamming or sharing 
to the question of the premisesfrom thoroughness. 
o Sari Savikoski: If we end up with option 1, then both spaces are ok. 
o Jaakko Timonen: If "under maintenance" is the same as "under construction" processes 
regarding, would it be better if there was only one space when they are responsible for the processes 
each other. However, I understand after the conversation that both of these 
is needed. 
o Päivi Karppanen: If we end up with option 1, then both spaces 
for the use of. 
o Petri Juhala: I agree. 
Summary for "subscription under maintenance" status. The recommendation is that ko. space is included, 
if we end up with option 1. 
Laura continued priming the next film (page 3 of the material). Laura elaborated, 
that this description has already been reviewed the previous time and this has been filled in 
in terms of measurement data, what the change means. There were no comments about this film. 
Laura continued the presentation (pages 4-6) regarding the proposed changes to the processes. 
A question arose for the group: is the update still allowed back under construction-
order from renovation/maintenance premises? 
o Päivi: What kind of errors are involved, if the space should be reclaimed under construction-
space, or can the repairs be done so that the space does not need to be updated? 
But if it is stated that this change is needed, I don't know why it should be 
resist. We prefer to ask the system suppliers about the situation 
initially.  
o Pia: Can there be a situation in connection maintenance where the meter has been removed, 
but it has not yet been connected, in which case it would need to be in the under construction state 
and the contract start date should change accordingly when the object 
let's hook up?  
o Summer: Everything is possible in repair situations, with subscription maintenance status 
should behave in the same way as the under-construction state, i.e. nothing 
should intervene because of this. Can something go wrong if we allow it? 
making a change?  
Marko asked if this functionality (making a restriction from one state to another) is therefore 
Soon as necessary, Pia stated that no. 
o Cherry: If the space has been accidentally changed from renovation to under construction, 
but otherwise it didn't occur to me. a situation where this should be possible 
make.

o Mia: I can't remember the situation, but I can't remember why it should be prevented, if 
sometimes needed for a repair situation. 
o Pekka: as a third party, this is not our core competence, decision 
to other parties. 
o Greetta: Personally, I would allow changes in all spaces, something can always happen 
weirder repair situations and it would be good if we get the repairs 
done by yourself, and not through a separate ticket. It would be given to network companies 
possibility / power to update without any separate rules.  
o Christian: Why would you start blocking? Maybe this question 
in the direction of the data hub. Is it a data thing again, to keep data 
more precisely, etc. because of which the room could not be changed. I don't see that we should 
no problem if you need to change rooms.  
o Jani: From the system's point of view, it is not necessary to block the update 
back to under construction status. 
o Pasi: You can't prevent it, it's easier this way, if you need to prevent it, that's fine 
realizable. 
o Sami: There is nothing to add, everything works. 
o Samuli: As mentioned in several comments, human ones 
errors appear from year to year and are completely based on guesswork 
quantitatively. I support if anything is restricted as little as possible 
corrective measures. No restrictions.  
o Sari: Along the same lines, I wouldn't put any restrictions on this, we have a bit of that situation, 
that you are not terribly focused on option 1.  
o Tarja: No new perspective on what has already been mentioned, no need to limit it. 
o Jaakko: There is no reason to limit. 
o Petri: There is no need for restrictions, these things are business needs and they 
see best what is needed. 
Summary for the limitation of facility changes: There is no need to limit what 
spaces can be changed to any space. 
Laura continued with regard to the mandatory information, which information is read from the renovation status 
mandatory? 
Pia asked if there are even meters at the "renovation" events? Mia stated that it may or may not be 
may not be. Jani commented that it could work in the same way as under construction-
in the state that there is no need to build separate validation rules, Christian and Sari were too 
of one mind.

Marko asked if there is something different about the mandatory information for the "Renovation" mode 
vision. No one presented a different view. Summaryto mandatory information 
regarding: The "Renovation" mode has the same mandatory information as the "Construction" mode. 
Laura continued going through option 1 and the workloads of option 1 were summarized and 
industry impact. 
Option 2:  
Laura initiated the possible implementation of option 2. Jani asked about case 3a, when 
the start date is not moved, and when the parties are not notified of the move, then the seller 
would you be able to conclude that the date does not move? Suvi comments the same as diagram 3a 
requires clarification. Jani comments that the description does not take a position on whether this is 
the same seller or a different seller, if the same seller, then the information can be mined from your own 
systems. If a completely new seller with customer B, then the history is nowhere to be found.  
Laura went through the options (page 12) and on what basis the parties would be able to 
to know that the information (contract start dates) will change. 
Two options have means for this (either email/option 1 or 
message/option 3) or alternatively information about contract date changes 
not sent at all (option 2).  
Pia stated that this is a problem for the sellers - they can't count on getting it 
built-in reasoning on whether the date should change in some case or not. 
Pia also stated that, as a seller, she does not want this to be an email, but that she needs the information 
come by saying according to which the contract is either updated or not updated. That would mean 
that a new message would be needed for this. Sari comments that option 3 is the best, 
should come by saying information about the change.  
Pia asked if it is intended that this be discussed in general, the intention is that 
can be put into production quickly, which option is more difficult to implement, which one 
can be obtained faster, which can be obtained cheaper? Marko stated that this is happening 
through in a moment, but first let's discuss the will state, which information option 
is recommended for option 2.  
o Summer: Cases 2 and 3 do not cover all use cases, e.g. new site, 
which has received several new contracts. So none of these are ready 
to be implemented. 
o Jani: Missing e.g. the scenario that there is a gap between the contracts, how then 
will be carried out if there is a place of use under construction. 
Suvi clarified that there is a lot of variation missing. Marko asked if this could still be done 
through? Marko also asked if there is anyone who opposes the 3rd option? Suvi asked, 
will there be a discussion about whether the network company finds these necessary, or how 
sellers find these necessary? Jani commented that we really need something new 
message and whether, for example, it is possible to add to existing connection messages 
information about the date. 
Marko summed up that apparently option 1 (of these three options) is not allowed 
support, option 3 needs to be taken further and defined / supplemented further.

Suvi comments that nobody wants option 1 and Marko comments that 
through option 2, no one would get information about the change, which is also not wanted.  
Jan commented in his role as datahub's system administrator that it doesn't affect 
a lot for the price estimate, if there aren't terribly many more different scenarios. Pia commented that 
often there is a situation where first a contract is made with the developer and then 
to the end customer. Suvi stated that the problem culminates precisely in the fact that the seller has to 
difficult to interpret which contract dates are transferred in which situation. Soil frost 
comments that often the building society is still involved before the final decision 
customer in this figure. In this situation, three different customers can have three different ones 
seller. 
Finally, there is a discussion about which of the implementation methods is the one with which 
let's move on:  
What the different options (option 1 and option 2) mean 
from the point of view of the system supplier?  
o Christian: I didn't have time to investigate the 2nd option more, but I think so 
which would cause that challenge. 
Pia asked what is easier/cheaper from the point of view of system suppliers 
implement. A completely new message or an additional stab at the connection message? Or that 
a new status will be introduced to the information of the place of use, according to which certain things would be done 
reasonings. 
o Christian continued: Even more, I would take a stab at the old message and 
to give it an understanding of what the event does. / Marko asked that if 
let's choose option 1 and 2, which one is more laborious? / Christian: both have 
work, no mentionable difference, I'm more interested in what would be here 
in terms of the seller's business and in terms of the network and data hub 
most reasonable. Both options are equal. 
o Jani: If we only think about the workload for the system of changes 
to implement,the easiest would be a change to the content of the connection message, the most 
would benefit from new facilities, option 1 is better. 
o Pasi: The amount of work is more or less the same in both and the facilities if there are any of them 
benefit, then it would be a more pleasant option. (option 1).  
o Sami: As a third-party representative, I can't say anything about this.  
o Samuli: Practically nothing matters to us, neither causes 
variation in our system development work. 
o Sari: Option 2 would be smaller for us in terms of workload and such 
Jani said, for the network it is not essential to get that information, only for the seller 
there is. Stabbing the connection message would sound better. 
o Tarja: In our case, option 2 is smaller and 
in favor of it, originally we had considered that the new messages that were on display

would have been good, but now that one has listened to the conversation, it would sound like that 
preferably if an existing message is used for the date 
for reporting. 
Sari elaborated that if we are going to stab the existing message, we should 
for the seller to be clear about the date of the contract 
moving. Suvi stated that in this case datahub should take over 
of the network connection notification and informs the seller about this with reasoning, if 
need requires. Sari continued that if stabbing an existing message is not possible 
to use, preferably then a new message. You need to know what the agreement is 
updating and for which day, these must be clear.  
o Jaakko: Option 1 is easier to implement and less work. 
o Petri: Option 2 and new messages, but option 1 is also ok 
o Päivi: Regarding option 1, the facilities would be so clear, but I understand very well if 
Option 2 is easier and cheaper to implement, so option 2 is also ok 
and perhaps reasonable to end there.  Option 2.  
Marko commented that, from the point of view of datahub, the workloads for the alternatives do not differ 
a lot, and from the point of view of system suppliers, they seem to be pretty much the same 
workers, so when weighing the options you should think that when you start this 
change, so they will be used for years to come.  
o Pia: Doesn't matter, as long as we get the correct dates into the system without 
that interim agreements etc. must be done due to repairs 
o Greetta: The most important thing is that during the renovation, the contracts for the places of use 
don't break, in terms of customer service it would be nice to have new facilities, but 
cost and schedules are the realities that have to be followed, when 
we go with option 2. I personally think that option 2 is a smaller change. 
However, it is not absolute, it is enough that everyone understands what is changing. 
o Kirsi: with two stages, I would have voted for option 1, the others have been that 
think that too many (space) options can be a big risk. This is why I convert 
to option 2.  
o Suvi: I support option 2, because in option 1 the whole existing one 
changing the user base to the right mode is laborious. Option 2 
there is still a lot to be done, it is necessary to define what information is transmitted, 
whether forwarded to the seller or the network or just to someone else and all those use cases 
what to consider here.  
o Mia: Along the same lines, option 2 is better. At first I was option 1 
side, but what we have discussed now, I prefer option 2.  
o Pekka: Based on what I heard, 2 as a whole sounds reasonable, but 
as a third party, this does not matter to us.

Päivi asked how quickly this would be put into use? Marko commented that 
this depends on how the wish is prioritized with other changes this year 
the change is not coming in any case, it may not be until next year 
in the latter major version.  
Marko thought about how to achieve the different scenarios of option 2 most efficiently 
to the industry for comment, whether they are defined in the business process documentation 
or how. Datahub is thinking about this in more detail. 
➔ Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Marko summed up that we are in option 2 
ending. You have to define whether the cases missing from the option are even more detailed.  
o #176, site of use process, Laura introduced the development proposal and it 
solution description 
Laura grounded the desire for change, i.e. the transfer of netting calculation information to JVH, 
after the datahub sets the netting tihis own reasoning for the place of use of edo 
based on A message will be sent to the seller, but with the proposal, the message would also be sent 
to the network. Alternatively, the acknowledgment message received by the network would be used 
about updating. Option 1 = new message, option 2 = acknowledgment message 
exploitation. 
How do you see these two options, is one of them clearly better than the new ones 
messages or acknowledgment message?  
o Petri: We were in Kuuittassanoma's position, so option 2 is better.  
o Christian: I will continue on the same track, I would stab the acknowledgment message 
rather than creating a new message.  
o Jani: Does the network not understand when the point of use is netting?  
Laura elaborated that yes, we wanted information from the datahub, whether there is a datahub 
set the item to netting or not. Jani asked how this is different for herself 
about the acknowledgment of the event, Laura specified that parallelism does not always mean, 
that the netting is on, i.e. nothing can be done directly from the current receipt 
deduce. Jani recalled that this had been discussed before the 2.0 version, that 
does the network need such information. Then it was stated that the network already knows these 
data, in this case datahub does not have to certify that "we agree 
on the subject". 
Tarja stated that there have been situations where datahub disagrees with 
our system, when such information would be considered important 
also towards the network operator, in which case the network operator and the seller get the same 
the same information about the place of use. Jani asked if there would be information in advance that 
the item will be netted in a couple of days, but the situation can still be improved 
shift? Laura comments that the netting information can only change for DH-126-/127-
with the messages. If an update of the usage location data is attempted, which should 
change the netting information, then they will not be allowed through. Tarja stated that netting information 
is information that significantly affects invoicing, so it is considered important that 
these exceptional situations could be excluded with this announcement.

o Tarja: I would support option 1, new messages would be used on the matter 
for communication.  
o Pasi: I suddenly can't say which option is better. I vote blank, 
I'm not against change. The industry decides whether to make a change or not.  
o Sami: There is no position on this. 
o Samuli: Both options are bad, netting calculation 
there are two cases in the regulation when netting cannot be carried out 1) 
limitation related to the size of the equipment 2) the case outlined by the Energy Industry Association, 
where the place of use is equipped with two measuring devices. The setting does not allow 
deviate from this netting, and because of this to the datahub's process logic 
there are certain legalities, when the netting is set on or not 
on. A possible conflict in the network and data hub information is difficult 
explain to the end customer. 
Marko asked if you don't want both options? Samuli stated, 
that the change is in order, but neither option is the current one 
correct the situation. The network should know if the target is netting or not. 99% 
items must be netted, and when this is not the case in the data hub, it should be 
this is nice to know. This does not remove the (fact) that netting should still be done 
run.  
o Sari: The network should find this out from datahub, option 1 would be ours 
our suggestions, our experts' comments about this did not go 
even more strongly in favor of either option. 
o Jaakko: It wasn't clear which would be the better option, I'm going to abstain.  
Marko asked if we are in favor of this development proposal at all? 
Jaakko commented that he didn't see this as important, but for some others 
systems may be more important. 
o Jani: Let's make 1 option then with a new message type, if this is the case 
the change is starting to be made. 
o Pia: Based on the comments, I was left wondering if the problem is just that 
in certain systems. Suvi agrees that it was originally wanted 
to know from the system suppliers whether there is a need for this or not. Experience 
system suppliers, whether it is necessary and mandatory to have, or whether it is 
necessary to make other developments. As a party, you cannot take a position on this. 
Pia continued asking if this ticket is old, if this is even necessary anymore 
change. Marko stated that the ticket came six months ago. Tarja stated that 
the situation has only started to show itself after the turn of the year and this is 
quite appropriate and necessary change. Tarja also comments that no 
would be happy to ignore this and state that no change is needed. 
o Suvi: I give authority to the system suppliers, whether they feel it is necessary 
or not.

Tarja stated that it has not been fully clarified why some people have it 
different knowledge of the netting situation. You can't say that there is only your own system 
fault, Sari agreed that change is needed. 
Greetta stated that, yes, it is still possible to search for deviating information, it has been run, e.g. 
separate error lists. For example, the network thinks that the object belongs to netting, 
but it is not heard in datahub. The network should know and find the errors itself. 
Greetta asked if it would be possible to retrieve this information from the CMS reports, that 
the item is not netting, even if the item has a parallel use location 
exist? Jan stated that such a report should not be a problem.  
Sari commented that if datahub does netting reasoning, and in its own 
there is no corresponding information in the system and the information must be forwarded to a third party 
into the system and somehow it should be concluded whether the object is netting. Pia asked, 
shouldn't everyone be netting if there is only one meter? Samuli stated, 
that this is the basic problem he referred to earlier. By default 
the object should be in netting, but the current processes do not support errors 
correction, items cannot be corrected retroactively. Samuli commented that 
we have often had cases where the item has been netted and then 
the data is changed and this is excluded from the netting calculation. Samuli continued that he should 
stumble so much that this is also a problem for them in that sense, when 
the network receives netted information about the measurement from the data hub, but does not 
non-net information about the measurement, in which case there will be a lot of interpretations that you should now 
sends a raw measurement to a clip.  
Pia stated that, in the big picture, it would make more sense to make a report on this and 
it would be thought that information about the place of use would be possible in a repair situation 
fix. Suvi agreed, time limits are a problem, which manifests e.g. 
in datahub malfunctions. The fault is not necessarily on the party's end, but 
for example, the event has never been forwarded to the data hub. Pia stated that 
a report could be useful showing that an error has occurred and the error 
could be fixed. Suvi commented that the report would be easier than that 
new messages would be built for use by the parties. Pia commented that 
certain information should be able to be corrected retroactively. Samuli agreed, 
that after 2.0, certain things cannot be fixed retroactively. Laura commented, 
that if retroactive corrections are made, the calculation will not take it into account 
these, because the calculation only takes place in connection with the delivery of measurement data. 
Because of this, the changes are only planned for the future. Samuli 
stated that in this case the measurement data could be sent again, to the network 
should just send a reminder message that "send the measurement data again".  
Päivi asked if Sari and Tarja think that a report could solve the problem 
this problem? Tarja stated that she herself cannot say this suddenly. Flashbacks 
the changes have to be seen in the report, which Tarja stated is not quite this 
convinced, because it means that the data should be corrected manually. 
With retroactive repair possibilities, things would start to improve. Sari said no 
even sitting here, you can take a stand on this.  
Let's finish the comments:

o Päivi: We have to consider how big the problem is, for how many and how 
many cases are related to this. The problem may be genuine, but there are parties, 
for whom this is not a problem. Would it be possible to work together to find the reason for this, 
that why this doesn't work for everyone and with that find out if this 
the right need for change. You have to think about what should be done and what 
there are options.  
Marko stated that one option is to leave it on the table and think about it 
options beyond. 
o Summer: No continuation, because it only applies to certain parties and certain parties 
system suppliers. It's also okay to think about only certain ones 
for the parties, more. 
o Mia: I agree, it hasn't been a problem for us, and I'm not in favor of continuing if 
there will be no compelling need. 
o Pekka: There is not enough information to be able to defend, will require additional explanations, 
why some systems have a challenge. 
➔ Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Marko stated that the development proposal will be continued 
clarification and repair possibilities and we will go through the case separately with Tarja and Sari 
more specifically. 
Greetta left at 14:09 
o #33+#114, contract process, Jenni presented the development proposals and thesesolution descriptions, as well as the reason why this was brought to system vendors 
to discuss. 
▪ 
more information in appendices 3 "Development proposal-33 - review" and 4 
"Development proposals 33 and 114" 
o Jani: (referring to section 33 of the Development Proposal in the appendix, where it is mentioned that 
the reasons for ending and starting the contracts must be the same) Is it necessary 
to check whether the reason codes are the same if there is a move-in and for the old one 
does the customer inform the seller that the contract is ending? If the customer puts 
wrong reason in the online service, or vice versa. Or if in the future 
there will be a change of seller, so the old seller will not be allowed to move out anymore. Marko 
stated that this will be taken into account in further planning. 
o Pia: Do the systems tend to the fact that if the contract already has information that 
the contract is already ending with moving out - how can it be in the system 
announce the end again? 
o Christian: It's challenging to start building this. 
o Jani: Re-sending the decision to the same day succeeds. 
o Pasi: I have to implement it, it hasn't occurred to me yet why it couldn't be done 
to implement.

o Sami: Nothing to say about this, nothing to do with this. 
o Samuli: As a representative of measurement information, it is not important for us. 
o Sari: Yes, it can be done. 
o Tarja: Not possible at the moment, but can be done with a little work. 
o Jaakko: I can't comment on this. 
o Petri: It's not possible at the moment, but it's not a big development task. 
Marko summed up that there are no obstacles on the part of the system suppliers to the #33 development proposal 
for moving forward. 
Jani also comments on the wording that "the network company can respond", 
is the network company also able to start the decision chain, Jenni stated that 
option #33 already mentions that the network company can also start, 
but let's elaborate on proposal #114 in this regard.  
o Suvi comments that these are now being corrected retroactively and should be able to do this 
emigration to register. A party should have the ability to ensure that 
the customer's contract actually ends when the customer has notified this. 
o Pia: Let's continue if this reduces repairs by a large part. 
o Mia: Let's continue. 
o Päivi: Let's continue. 
o Kirsi: Let's continue. 
o Pekka: Let's continue 
➔ Summary of the proposal and its promotion: Let's go ahead with proposals #33 and #114 
ahead. Some of the system suppliers are ready for this, and some have the opportunity with a little effort 
implement the change. 
 
o For the information of the development working group, the preparation situation applies to the list of development proposals 
the following items in appendix 1 "Datahub change requests 20230330":  
o #160, contract process, Jenni presented the situation of the development proposal and that 
the proposal is more complicated than previously considered, let's continue this 
thinking about internally and brought to the table later.  
The meeting time had been exceeded, and there was no time to proceed with proposal #178.  
o #178, Measurement Data Process, Annex 5
