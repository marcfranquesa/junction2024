Goals of development proposal #203
• Minimize energy remaining in network losses and more correct allocation to the seller
in the balance settlement with more accurate disconnection/connection times.
• Usage point disconnection/connection times with minute accuracy in Datahub
to better correspond to reality (close to the actual disconnection/connection time).

Notes and assumptions
•
Disconnection and connection cannot be announced in the future.
•
Connection and disconnection are processed according to the usage point time step. Currently, 
datahub's recommendation is that the disconnection time be set to the next quarter of an hour/hour, so that 
the consumption prior to the disconnection is not recorded as network losses, but delaying the notification causes challenges for some parties (and system suppliers) and they 
set the disconnection time to the previous quarter of an hour/hour. 
•
The following cases have been prepared on the assumption that if the point of use is 
disconnected, then there will be no consumption for that period and thus no energy to be allocated for balance settlement.

Solution options
A. Disconnection/connection times are reported to Datahub with minute accuracy and balance agreements and the status of the point of use are also processed with minute accuracy. The party whose balance the consumption goes to is determined according to the balance agreement situation at the beginning of the time step (15 
min or 1 h). The disconnection time in the system data corresponds to the actual situation. 
The metering data reminders do not currently support the solution, so further development would be needed for them as well. 
(rough workload estimate level 1 + significant workload from reminders)
B. Disconnection/connection times are reported to Datahub with minute accuracy, but the balance agreement in a disconnection situation
remains valid until the end of the disconnection time step (15 min/1 h). In a connection situation, the balance agreement is created
from the beginning of the connection time step. The status of the point of use is handled similarly to the balance agreement, which is why
a new attribute is needed for the exact disconnection/connection time. (rough workload estimate level 2/3)
•
More detailed examples of the options are described on slides 7-28.

Solution options, A advantages and disadvantages
Disconnection/connection times are reported to Datahub with minute accuracy and balance agreements are also processed with minute accuracy. The party whose balance
the consumption goes to is determined according to the balance agreement situation at the beginning of the time step (15 min or 1 h). 
•
The calculation takes into account the balance agreement according to how it is valid at the beginning of the time step at the time of the event. Examples from 15 min and 1 h 
use points: 
•
15 min kp: A disconnection at 8:22 means that the 15 min period starting at 08:15 goes entirely to the seller's balance. 
•
15 min connection at 8:22 means that the 15 min period starting at 8:15 goes to network losses and the period starting at 8:30 goes to the seller's balance. 
•
1 h connection at 8:22 means that the 1 h period starting at 08:00 goes entirely to the seller's balance. 
•
1 h connection at 8:22 means that the 1 h period starting at 8:00 goes to network losses and the period starting at 9:00 goes to the seller's balance. 
•
Since energy is determined according to the time step of the point of use, especially at the 1 h point of use, the energy distribution deviates from the disconnection time. 
•
Metering data reminders would require further development (increase in size not yet known) so that Datahub does not incorrectly remind about missing or 
disconnected metering data delivered to a point of use. The change will also have a slowing effect on system performance.

Solution options, B advantages and disadvantages
Disconnection/connection times are reported to Datahub with minute accuracy, but the balance agreement remains valid in a disconnection situation until the end of the time step (15 
min/1 h) at the moment of disconnection. In a connection situation, the balance agreement is created from the beginning of the time step at the moment of connection. The status of the usage point in Datahub follows the validity of the balance agreement, which is why a new attribute is needed for minute-level disconnection/connection information. 
•
At a 15 min usage point, the calculation result is the same in connection with disconnection as in option A, i.e. the consumption of the time step (15 min) at the moment of disconnection
goes to the seller's balance. 
•
In option B, the consumption of the time step (15 min) of the connection moment at the 15 min point of use also goes to the seller's balance. 
•
At the 1 h point of use, the hour period of the disconnection/connection moment goes to the seller's balance, because the balance agreement ends at the end of the hour of the disconnection/begins at the beginning of the hour of the connection moment.
•
Advantages: Calculation, point of use status and balance agreements are fully aligned with each other, i.e. no separate interpretation is required for the calculation. No changes are required to the metering information reminders. 
•
Disadvantages: The validity period of the balance agreement and point of use status differs from the actual exact connection/disconnection moment. A new attribute is needed to 
present the information correctly, as well as possible changes to the messages transmitted to the parties (e.g. DH-13x, DH-412/422) connection/disconnectionfor information.

Notes from the previous slide (24)
•
In option B) disconnection would end the balance agreement at 8:30 (at the beginning of the next quarter) and connection
would try to create a balance agreement at 8:15 (at the beginning of the previous quarter), even though there is already one at the place of use
balance agreement. When disconnection and connection occur during the same 15 min, the new one created by the connection
the balance agreement must start at the beginning of the next quarter. This should be taken into account in the DH-412 process:
•
When the DH-412 process recognizes that a balance agreement already exists (8:15 at the beginning of the quarter), the process
it is necessary to check whether the balance agreement ends or not. quarter to the end (8:30). If the balance agreement ends, yes
a new balance agreement will be created quarter of an hour from the end (8:30) instead of creating it from the beginning
(8:15).
•
Note In other situations, the normal DH-412 process rules of the balance agreement are followed
in terms of creation.

A) The balance agreement is valid from the moment of disconnection (8:22) and from the moment of connection (8:48).
The balance agreement can be found at the beginning of the class at 8:00, so hour's consumption goes to the seller 
to the balance sheet.
B) The balance agreement is valid until the end of the cut-off hour (9:00) and 
from the beginning of the hour of the connection moment (8:00). The handling of balance sheet agreements must be agreed 
in such a way that there is no overlap (special rules, see the next slide). 
In any case, the balance agreement is valid for the entire hour from 8:00 to 9:00 and an hour 
goes to the seller's balance sheet.

Notes from the previous slide (27)
•
In option B), disconnection would end the balance agreement at 9:00 (start of the next hour) and connection
would try to create a balance agreement starting at 8:00 (the beginning of the previous hour), even though the place of use already has one 
there is a balance agreement. When disconnection and connection occur during the same hour, created by the connection
the new balance agreement must start at the beginning of the next hour. This consideration DH-412-
in process:
•
When the DH-412 process recognizes that a balance agreement already exists (at the beginning of the 8:00 hour), the process
it is necessary to check whether the balance agreement ends or not. until the end of the hour (9:00). If the balance agreement ends, yes
a new balance sheet agreement will be created starting from from the end of the hour (9:00) instead of creating it 
from the beginning of class (8:00).
•
Note In other situations, the normal DH-412 process rules of the balance agreement are followed
in terms of creation.
