Opening the meeting, stating the attendees and the agenda 
Marko Juslin opened the meeting at 10:04, the attendees were noted and the meeting was held 
through the agenda. The purpose is to carefully review the development proposals and continue if necessary 
for those for which there is not enough time at the next meeting. The agenda (appendix 1) did not appear 
comments or additions.

Current overview of the data hub 
2.1  
Customer service – Jenni Mäkinen 
According to a separate presentation (Appendix 2), Jenni Mäkinen reviewed customer service 
current situation. The situation has calmed down considerably and there will be approx. 80 tickets 
per day. Most support requests can be processed during the same day. 
• 
Pia Aaltonen commented that the industry should be guided even better by contracts 
in cancellations. The instructions should be clearer and "twisted from iron wire". 
Especially at the moment, documentation and instructions are difficult to find and that 
the situation should be improved. 
• 
Pia commented that in the case of data protection tickets, making the tickets should be 
more unambiguous and clear. In the case of data protection labels, the events are 
always unique.

Päivi Karppanen commented that in the case of open events, events 
have not left the party's view, even if the transactions have been acknowledged 
deleted by the datahub operator. 
 
2.2  
Development team – Marko Juslin 
Marko presented the current members of the development team according to the presentation (Appendix 3). 
Datahub's availability has improved during the summer compared to spring and early summer 
to the situation.  
• 
Pia commented that there will still be timeouts when importing contracts 
in connection with. The import of large contract masses (hundreds at a time) at once requires parts 
repetition, not everything goes through at once due to timeouts. At the turn of the year 
tendering for municipal and city contracts, which can mean hundreds 
importing contracts at once. 
• 
Pia asked how datahub has researched additional contracts 
customer information updates. For example, customer data often comes from networks 
as an update request, the customer's old address information, even though the seller already has a customer 
new address known and updated in the system. Jenni commented that these 
are monitored e.g. through locks, i.e. Customer Data is locked and with these 
the parties are contacted. Suvi Manninen commented that the data hub should be abandoned 
unnecessary network updates. Fingrid examines the situation through more detailed examples and 
find out possible solutions to avoid unnecessary updates. 
• 
Greetta Arha comments that the party is not always aware of the correct information and 
the system can automatically send the information. Information about having sent 
unnecessary and false information is very welcome, as the parties can do 
updates sometimes unintentionally or unknowingly. 
• 
Suvi commented that the information about the lockdowns has arrived and the chain of events for these 
has been investigated. The parties often make their own interpretations and contacts 
between networks and sellers. The hope is that more supervision is done by Fingrid 
side. 
3  
Presentation of development proposals and recommendation decision 
Development proposals and their descriptions and solutions are presented in Appendix 4 "Datahub 
wishes for change 20220822". Comments on the development proposals are wanted from everyone in the group 
from the members, with the support or rejection of the group, development proposals can be exported 
forward as agreed. The size category of the development proposal describes the development proposal 
preliminary rough price estimate (1: less than €10,000, 2: €10,000-50,000, 3: over €50,000). 
Marko stated that change can be pi in itselfeni (planning and implementation), but 
maintaining test cases can in some cases be a bigger job to ensure that 
the quality of datahub system version delivery remains good.

the necessary development proposal is 
o Päivi: price vs. additional benefit does not match, but another channel would be better 
like email

o Mia: in favor, I prefer dates by text rather than e-mail 
through 
o Greetta: no favors, cost vs. additional benefit does not match 
o Kari: good functionality in itself, but certainly more necessary on the list 
suggestions 
o Kirsi: ok suggestion, is similar information available in the report 
o The common view of the development group: does not support the development proposal 
along with the costs, the solution is not completely ideal and the costs 
relatively high.

#31 (Suvi Manninen Caruna), customer process,  
o Suvi presented the development proposal and Laura presented the solution proposal 
▪ 
Pia commented that the validation according to the proposal was in use 
In Tita, so it should also be the default in datahub. 
o Kirsi: supported, more of a bug than a development proposal 
o Kari, Greetta and Mia: in favor, "Titta rules" should be used 
o Summer: validations should be bundled and similar validation should be done for others as well 
for customer information. 
o Päivi, Pia, Pekka and Jari: supported, this sounds more like a bug 
than a development proposal 
o The common view of the development group: we support the development proposal. 
Development proposals regarding contract processes would be good to bundle together, 
in order to move forward more cost-effectively and maintain the whole 
united. 
• 
#78 (Fingrid), customer process,  
o Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description 
o Jari: must be passed, the law requires this 
o Pekka: does this type even have to be handled through the development team 
o Pia: have the changes prescribed by law been included in the maintenance of the data hub or 
are these always required to be passed through development proposals? 
o Päivi, Suvi, Mia, Greetta, Kari, Kirsi: supported 
o The common view of the development group: we support the development proposal. 
It was questioned whether there was even a need to bring such matters to the group 
or is it enough to just inform about the change? 
• 
#19 (Fingrid), point of use process,  
o Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description 
o Networks currently update information in varying ways, some update their own 
in the system, but data is not always exporteduntil the hub, so as not to overload 
too much system.

o Kari: the GDPR-compliant operations must be checked carefully, no change is allowed 
skip this 
o Greetta: GDPR should be taken into account, not necessary unless it is from the point of view of the sellers 
absolutely necessary 
o Mia: what does the seller do with the new consumption estimate if the contract has already been concluded 
based on previous knowledge. Not recommended, especially considering the price. 
o Summer: not supported, the seller will still get the information later by applying 
location of use information during the validity of the contract. As affairs stand 
the annual usage estimate is not the basis for invoicing, more of an old relic. 
o Päivi: not supported 
o Pia: the consumption estimate always comes from the web, customers are not asked or required to do this. 
Not supported. 
o Pekka: should we invest in the quality of the annual usage estimate in the data hub? 
sellers can access the data from here for future electricity procurement, no 
need for sellers' own assessments. Doesn't sound like a GDPR thing because the contract 
however, exists. No more like this, green if that's the case 
otherwise better 
o Jari: not supported, if the annual usage estimate cannot otherwise be trusted, 
is not a GDPR issue. 
o Cherry: no support as described here 
o The joint view of the development group: does not support the development proposal. Let's go back 
possibly later if the situation changes. 
• 
#59 (Suvi Manninen Caruna), place of use process, 
o Suvi presented the development proposal and Laura presented the solution proposal 
▪ 
There are a lot of requests for updates of usage location information for networks that are not 
valid, about 10% are valid and concern updating the address. 
▪ 
Pia pointed out that the perception has been that the update request in question 
would have been created only for updating the address information of the place of use, and not 
would allow update requests for other location information. 
o Jari: supported, when there is a small change, you should also be in touch 
operators as well as their system suppliers in order to avoid 
"disassembly solution". Fingrid has the responsibility to take the matter up with the parties 
ahead. 
o Pekka: should the problem be fixed sooner at the starting end and not add a plug 
only to datahub. Can datahub figure out where the invalid update request came from 
will come and clarify the situations with the respective parties.

o Pia: Fingrid should first contact the parties concerned 
send update requests and discuss possible changes in their 
in their systems. If the change is not successful for the parties, the change 
costs should be borne by these parties, not the whole 
from the development budget. 
o Päivi: discussion with the parties first, no change immediately 
as a development proposal 
o Mia: discussion with the parties first, no change immediately 
as a development proposal 
o Greetta: discussion with the parties first, no change immediately 
as a development proposal. In general, updates of location information should be allowed 
only address changes, this is where a separate development proposal is raised.

as a development proposal. 
o Kirsi: discussion with the parties first, no change immediately

situation with the parties and go through any changes they may have 
on his side. Further actions will be considered based on these. 
• 
#65(Fingrid), authorization process  
o Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description 
o Kari: a logical suggestion, services should have rights according to the role 
o Greetta: a logical proposal, the price sounds high for this proposal, 
forced to push this change forward 
o Mia: good proposal and requires further export 
o Summer: the problem in question must be fixed. If there are others for authorization 
proposals and changes, they should be dealt with uniformly. 
o Päivi: necessary change 
o Pia: can I ask her for two price tags, one for the customer portal and 
another data hub regarding events/parties. Could you 
also handle the problem regarding events/parties with instructions? 
The change regarding the customer portal is necessary and is advocated. 
o Pekka: two changes regarding price tags and the customer portal can be made 
advocate.

o Jari: two changes regarding the price tags and the customer portal can be made 
advocate, the most urgent and important. 
o Kirsi: authorizations according to the role and two price tags for the proposal 
o The joint vision of the development group: we especially advocate change 
regarding the customer portal, as it is more urgent in priority and 
prior. Separate price tags are requested for changes in the customer portal and 
in terms of process change. We will consider the implementation according to the price estimate 
in terms of process change. 
• 
#9 (Fingrid), product information process 
o Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description 
o Everyone is in favor of the proposal, because it is the equivalent required by law 
change.  
o The change is very acute, should it be demanded within the schedule first? 
mass update and only later the possibility of a separate tax rate 
to update. It should be noted that the change does not only apply to sales 
products, but should apply to everyone. It is good to inform the parties about this 
in good time as soon as more detailed information is available. 
o The common view of the development group: we support the development proposal. This one 
in addition, it should be checked whether there is a need to quickly update the current ones 
already declared products (seller's products). 
• 
#49(Fingrid), information security 
o Laura presented the development proposal and its solution description 
▪ 
Pia commented on whether the presented 3-month transition period is too short, 6 months could be 
be more suitable. The transition period will be increased to 6 months. 
o Everyone is in favor of the proposal and it will be carried forward. 
o The common view of the development group: we support the development proposal. 
The following proposals require a discussion in the working group, how they want to be solved, 
in the appendix "Datahub changes wishes 20220822 background for discussion. 
Within the framework of the schedule, development proposals #57 and #104 (related to 
#57 for discussion).  
• 
#57 (Suvi Manninen Caruna), contract process, 
o Suvi presented the development proposal 
o Pia said that the problem is that networks do not fully know how to 'Build' -
use of the space and it is not known how it affects the start dates of the contracts.

In addition, the Under Construction mode may swim to the side of the network, e.g. contractors 
side. There would clearly be a need for new state information, e.g. 
"In renovation". 
o #104(Fingrid), contract process, related to #57 discussion 
▪ 
Jenni presented the development proposal 
▪ 
Kirsi commented that they have contracts for the renovation sites 
to be decided before the renovation. The problem does not arise with this. 
Pia comments that this method of operation is not possible for everyone 
in the current market situation, because of old contracts 
want to hold on. 
▪ 
Not all objects have similar problem situations 
the numbers are smaller. 
▪ 
Päivi commented that new properties and properties to be renovated cannot 
treated in the same way. The handling of these should be different 
processes and status information. 
o Greetta proposed that the whole should be considered as a solution proposal 
taking into account new properties, renovated properties and properties under maintenance. 
The following status information is required: "Under construction", "Connection under maintenance" and 
"In renovation". "Connection under maintenance" mode would work with similar logic 
than "Under Construction" mode.  
o According to Pia, the status information in question is also necessary for the seller and helps 
understanding the target's situations. Jari tripped that in the repair 
the required new status information should be comprehensively reviewed. All of the above 
the situations are very different and cannot be treated in the same way 
by. 
▪ 
The solution presumably requires changes by the parties as well 
systems and therefore the solution proposal should also be consulted 
through a sub-working group of system suppliers. 
o Based on the discussion of the development working group, the proposed solution is:

o Suvi presented the development proposal and Jenni presented its solution description 
o Pia suggested option 2 as a solution. In addition, regarding cancellation code AR04 
instructionsusta needs to be clarified and simplified, it would be good to use the instructions 
with comments also in the development group. 
o Suvi described the use of cancellation code AR04 as a very problematic network 
point of view, because with its use there have been situations where the online contract is 
valid in between for a few days without a valid one 
sales contract. 
o Pia pointed out that the solution should be taken into account as desired 
to serve the end customer and the customer perspective is very important here. 
o Greetta suggested option 3) and this was also ET's 
strong vision of the development team. 
o Pia put forward the idea that, regarding AR04, we give up and cancel the contracts with a reason 
"moving out" until the cancellation date. Current of the sales companies of the notes 
situation, sellers don't have time for busy processing of contracts. 
o Kari, Greetta, Mia; Suvi, Päivi and Jari support proposal 3). 
o Pia supports proposal 2). 
o The joint view of the development group: we support the development proposal and it 
will be carried forward according to solution option 3). 
o #89 (Fingrid), contract process, related to #54 discussion  
The implemented development proposals did not have time to be reviewed within the schedule. Marko asked, 
is it still necessary to go through the development proposals that have already been implemented next time or 
is it enough that they are read through on their own? 
• 
The group stated that it is not necessary to go through them, but everyone goes through them independently 
through. If questions arise, they will be delivered no later than 2 weeks before 
the next meeting and we will go over it next time.
